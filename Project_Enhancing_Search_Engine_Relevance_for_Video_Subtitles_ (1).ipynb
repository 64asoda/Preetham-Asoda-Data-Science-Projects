00:01:33,278\\n(Lou humming)\\n\\n33\\n00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,330\\nI don't like any of these options.\\n\\n34\\n00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,700\\nSo, remote access lasts for 10 minutes.\\n\\n35\\n00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:42,633\\nSo I have control of this\\r\\nTesla for 10 minutes.\\n\\n36\\n00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:51,260\\nWhat am I using to\\r\\ninteract with the Tesla?\\n\\n37\\n00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:53,070\\nIs it my full action?\\n\\n38\\n00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,633\\nIs it something less than?\\n\\n39\\n00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,210\\n- Let me see what this\\r\\nspell says real quick.\\n\\n40\\n00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,470\\n- Is it his full action\\r\\nor something less than?\\n\\n41\\n00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:05,500\\n- You can use an electronic\\r\\ndevice within range\\n\\n42\\n00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,780\\nas if it were in your hands.\\n\\n43\\n00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,690\\nThis is not telekinesis.\\n\\n44\\n00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,700\\nRather the spell allows\\r\\nyou to simulate a device\\n\\n45\\n00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:12,470\\nas mechanical functions electronically,\\n\\n46\\n00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,160\\nyou are able to access only functions\\n\\n47\\n00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,290\\nthat a person using the device\\n\\n48\\n00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,220\\nmanually would be able to access.\\n\\n49\\n00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,960\\nYou can use remote access with\\r\\nonly one device at a time,\\n\\n50\\n00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,793\\nis what the spell says.\\n\\n51\\n00:02:20,793 --> 00:02:22,320\\n- Seems like free object\\r\\ninteraction to me.\\n\\n52\\n00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,620\\n- [Emily] Yeah, right?\\n\\n53\\n00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,220\\n- I am actually going to say,\\n\\n54\\n00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,140\\nlisten, this thing does have limits to it.\\n\\n55\\n00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,530\\nThe limits are as if\\r\\nit were in your hands,\\n\\n56\\n00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,900\\nthat's the limitation.\\n\\n57\\n00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,620\\nSo, it requires as much\\r\\nenergy and concentration\\n\\n58\\n00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:40,700\\nfor Kingston to control this Tesla\\n\\n59\\n00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,270\\nas it would for him to\\r\\ndrive it with his hands,\\n\\n60\\n00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,170\\nwhich makes it a free object interaction.\\n\\n61\\n00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:46,036\\n- Okay.\\n\\n62\\n00:02:46,036 --> 00:02:48,850\\n(Emily laughing)\\n\\n63\\n00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:49,683\\n- Incredible.\\n\\n64\\n00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,810\\n- Okay, if it's a free\\r\\n- I love it.\\n\\n65\\n00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:53,200\\n- object interaction...\\n\\n66\\n00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,100\\nOkay, this is again, when you\\r\\ntell me I could do anything,\\n\\n67\\n00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,130\\nit's honestly worse.\\n\\n68\\n00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,773\\nLike I would have\\r\\npreferred you told me, no,\\n\\n69\\n00:02:58,773 --> 00:03:01,573\\n'cause then it would have\\r\\nbeen clearer what I should do.\\n\\n70\\n00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:09,079\\nOkay, because Cody needs help.\\n\\n71\\n00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,160\\nCody is 110 feet away from me.\\n\\n72\\n00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,957\\nThere are three devils around me.\\n\\n73\\n00:03:15,957 --> 00:03:17,620\\nOh, but it's okay.\\n\\n74\\n00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,000\\nOh, okay.\\n\\n75\\n00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,127\\n- You could hold your action.\\n\\n76\\n00:03:21,127 --> 00:03:25,400\\n- If it's gonna screw\\r\\nover JJ, I don't know.\\n\\n77\\n00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,630\\n- I don't think...\\n\\n78\\n00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:30,680\\nJJ is invisible, but I\\r\\nthink we can make this work.\\n\\n79\\n00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,870\\nHold on.\\n\\n80\\n00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,960\\nCan we do this?\\n\\n81\\n00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:36,180\\nYou tell me, Brennan,\\r\\nif this gets too crazy.\\n\\n82\\n00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:38,740\\nI'd like to have the Tesla\\n\\n83\\n00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:43,130\\nagain do the thing where it's\\r\\nscrapes against the wall.\\n\\n84\\n00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:47,150\\nI then like to disengage,\\r\\nto run and hop in the Tesla.\\n\\n85\\n00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:50,720\\nI'd then like to be\\r\\ndriving the Tesla closer\\n\\n86\\n00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,720\\nto Ricky et al and cast\\r\\na bonus action spell.\\n\\n87\\n00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,070\\nCan I do all those things?\\n\\n88\\n00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:00,920\\n- You may do all those things.\\n\\n89\\n00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:01,791\\n- Fantastic.\\n\\n90\\n00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:04,170\\n(Emily Laughing)\\n\\n91\\n00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:08,710\\n- Yes, we descend back\\r\\ninto the Manhattan entrance\\n\\n92\\n00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,140\\nof the Holland

actually.\\n\\n1065\\n00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:51,180\\n- Okay, so 10.\\n\\n1066\\n00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:54,200\\n- I think Sofia is as\\r\\nconflicted as you right now.\\n\\n1067\\n00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,880\\nI think that it's just like...\\n\\n1068\\n00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:00,560\\nBecause obviously taking the sacred texts\\n\\n1069\\n00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,970\\nout of the monastery feels\\r\\na little sacrilegious, but--\\n\\n1070\\n00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:06,119\\n- Yeah.\\n\\n1071\\n00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:10,060\\nI think Tony is an easier\\r\\nthing to keep an eye on,\\n\\n1072\\n00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:13,460\\nthan worrying about removing\\r\\ntexts from the monastery.\\n\\n1073\\n00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,110\\nSo I'm going to say,\\r\\n\\\"Yeah, let's do monastery.\\\"\\n\\n1074\\n00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:16,943\\n- Hell, yeah.\\n\\n1075\\n00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:20,517\\nThe next day--\\n\\n1076\\n00:45:23,117 --> 00:45:25,677\\n- Oh, that means everyone's\\r\\ngoing to come to Staten Island.\\n\\n1077\\n00:45:25,677 --> 00:45:27,338\\n- Oh my God.\\n\\n1078\\n00:45:27,338 --> 00:45:28,586\\n- Oh boy.\\n\\n1079\\n00:45:28,586 --> 00:45:29,580\\n- Oh my gosh.\\n\\n1080\\n00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:31,420\\nI go around, I'm picking up trash\\n\\n1081\\n00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,570\\ntrying to make it look\\r\\nas nice as possible.\\n\\n1082\\n00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:39,680\\nI do like Belle in the\\r\\nBeauty and the Beast\\n\\n1083\\n00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,763\\nfor Staten Island.\\n\\n1084\\n00:45:42,050 --> 00:45:43,970\\n- A maid just throughout\\r\\nall the Staten Island\\n\\n1085\\n00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:45,810\\ngetting everything\\r\\nperfectly ready for people.\\n\\n1086\\n00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,607\\nWhen Sofia approaches Esther saying,\\n\\n1087\\n00:45:48,607 --> 00:45:50,050\\n\\\"Hey, we probably do the monastery.\\\"\\n\\n1088\\n00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:52,693\\nEsther says, \\\"Got it makes perfect sense.\\n\\n1089\\n00:45:54,427 --> 00:45:57,887\\n\\\"We can approach the monastery.\\n\\n1090\\n00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:00,260\\n\\\"We'll put out a formal

sofa\\n\\n1093\\n00:46:06,370 --> 00:46:09,310\\nand is like you good for a\\r\\nmeeting in two days, sweetie?\\n\\n1094\\n00:46:09,310 --> 00:46:11,130\\nCan you get that time\\r\\noff of helping

be okay.\\n\\n1098\\n00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,843\\n- Cool, she looks at you and says,\\n\\n1099\\n00:46:21,707 --> 00:46:24,040\\n\\\"Cool, good, good, good.\\\"\\n\\n1100\\n00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,110\\nShe also texts Madam Anastasia\\n\\n1101\\n00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:30,030\\nor rather she sends a formal\\r\\ninvite to Madam Anastasia\\n\\n1102\\n00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:35,030\\nand

00:52:20,763\\nin the waking world,\\n\\n1232\\n00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:24,203\\nbut here in the dreaming\\r\\nsky is rich with stars.\\n\\n1233\\n00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:28,819\\nGo ahead and give me a perception check.\\n\\n1234\\n00:52:28,819 --> 00:52:30,237\\n(dramatic music)\\n\\n1235\\n00:52:30,237 --> 00:52:31,070\\n- Okay.\\n\\n1236\\n00:52:33,432 --> 00:52:34,682\\nThat is a nine.\\n\\n1237\\n00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:42,733\\n- You can't tell why, but it's\\r\\nnot as bright here right now.\\n\\n1238\\n00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:48,380\\nYou're looking around the buildings.\\n\\n1239\\n00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:51,720\\nAnd normally the buildings\\r\\nare alive with lights.\\n\\n1240\\n00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:54,310\\nBut you know that the\\r\\nlights are on in places\\n\\n1241\\n00:52:54,310 --> 00:52:59,310\\nwhere people are dreaming\\r\\nand you're looking around\\n\\n1242\\n00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:02,880\\nand just seeing that there aren't a lot\\n\\n1243\\n00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:10,780\\nof dreaming people in the city.\\n\\n1244\\n00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:12,080\\nI mean, there's plenty.\\n\\n1245\\n00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:13,020\\nThere's lots, right?\\n\\n1246\\n00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:14,940\\nYou're looking around and\\r\\nsee us millions of people,\\n\\n1247\\n00:53:14,940 --> 00:53:18,720\\nBut God, do you think these\\r\\nbuildings used to be brighter?\\n\\n1248\\n00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,880\\nAnd you're seeing rooms\\n\\n1249\\n00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,258\\nand apartments here in Nod that are dark.\\n\\n1250\\n00:53:23,258 --> 00:53:25,560\\n(dramatic music)\\n\\n1251\\n00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,570\\nYou know, there are dark\\r\\napartments in Nod all the time.\\n\\n1252\\n00:53:27,570 --> 00:53:29,870\\nPeople are out of town,\\r\\npeople aren't home.\\n\\n1253\\n00:53:29,870 --> 00:53:31,860\\nThey're awake during the night.\\n\\n1254\\n00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:33,683\\nSo they're not at home dreaming.\\n\\n1255\\n00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,630\\nNod is always sort of purpley and misty\\n\\n1256\\n00:53:38,630 --> 00:53:40,010\\nand swirling in Indigo.\\n\\n1257\\n00:53:40,010 --> 00:53:42,760\\n(dramatic music)\\n\\n1258\\n00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:48,233\\nYou feel arising in your stomach almost\\n\\n1259\\n00:53:48,233 --> 00:53:49,970\\nin that way of like a car going\\n\\n1260\\n00:53:49,970 --> 00:53:52,383\\nover a bump in the road\\r\\nor something like that.\\n\\n1261\\n00:53:53,769 --> 00:53:57,767\\nAnd you feel a wash of something\\r\\naround you of raw umbra.\\n\\n1262\\n00:54:00,338 --> 00:54:01,171\\n- Fuck.\\n\\n1263\\n00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:09,060\\n- One or two little\\r\\nlights go out, not big,\\n\\n1264\\n00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:10,633\\njust one or two twinkle out.\\n\\n1265\\n00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:19,530\\nYou look behind you, behind\\r\\nyou is Times Square in Nod.\\n\\n1266\\n00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:28,220\\nWhich is bright,\\r\\ncolorful, even more bright\\n\\n1267\\n00:54:28,340 --> 00:54:33,273\\nand colorful in the dream\\r\\nworld than it is anywhere else.\\n\\n1268\\n00:54:35,130 --> 00:54:37,840\\nYou haven't fucked around\\r\\nwith Times Square in a while.\\n\\n1269\\n00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,910\\nBecause Times Square is where everything\\n\\n1270\\n00:54:39,910 --> 00:54:42,420\\nfucking went down three years ago.\\n\\n1271\\n00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:45,770\\nAnd you know that the Paragon\\r\\ndoorway is closed and sealed.\\n\\n1272\\n00:54:45,770 --> 00:54:46,603\\nIt's safe.\\n\\n1273\\n00:54:46,603 --> 00:54:47,436\\nYou've taken care of that.\\n\\n1274\\n00:54:47,436 --> 00:54:50,270\\nYou've been doing your\\r\\nthing, but there is...\\n\\n1275\\n00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:52,963\\nYou sense something out\\r\\nthere in Times Square.\\n\\n1276\\n00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:58,920\\n- Can I try something?\\n\\n1277\\n00:54:58,920 --> 00:54:59,753\\n- Yeah.\\n\\n1278\\n00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:03,448\\n- So this umbra around me, right?\\n\\n1279\\n00:55:03,448 --> 00:55:04,740\\n- Yeah.\\n\\n1280\\n00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:05,730\\n- That I've been seeing.\\n\\n1281\\n00:55:05,730 --> 00:55:07,880\\nDo I recognize it from like other places?\\n\\n1282\\n00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,123\\nLike this is what I've just been seeing.\\n\\n1283\\n00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,260\\n- Yeah, it's hard.\\n\\n1284\\n00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:14,400\\nYou realize it's always there.\\n\\n1285\\n00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,930\\nIt's like how you can't really\\r\\nsee humidity in the air.\\n\\n1286\\n00:55:18,930 --> 00:55:21,020\\nUnless someone shows you a picture,\\n\\n1287\\n00:55:21,020 --> 00:55:24,008\\nof like, \\\"Here's on a\\r\\nclear day and here's on...\\\"\\n\\n1288\\n00:55:24,008 --> 00:55:25,580\\nAnd you go, \\\"Oh shit,\\r\\nthere is a big difference.\\\"\\n\\n1289\\n00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:27,010\\n- But you'd never would look for it.\\n\\n1290\\n00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:28,963\\nThat's sort of what Umbra is here.\\n\\n1291\\n00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:31,740\\nYeah.\\n\\n1292\\n00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:35,827\\n- Can I just start saying\\r\\nout loud things like,\\n\\n1293\\n00:55:35,827 --> 00:55:38,863\\n\\\"Fuck all the people here.\\n\\n1294\\n00:55:39,910 --> 00:55:43,660\\nHonestly, fuck the\\r\\nparty, these New Yorkers.\\n\\n1295\\n00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:47,120\\nKingston needs to leave,\\r\\nhe's never seen Europe.\\n\\n1296\\n00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,997\\nWhat fucking dumb guy.\\\"\\n\\n1297\\n00:55:49,997 --> 00:55:50,830\\n(Brennan laughs)\\n\\n1298\\n00:55:50,830 --> 00:55:55,050\\nCan I just start talking shit on New York?\\n\\n1299\\n00:55:55,050 --> 00:55:56,990\\n- Give me a deception roll.\\n\\n1300\\n00:55:56,990 --> 00:56:01,990\\n- Okay, oh, I have good deception\\r\\nroll I was a drug dealer.\\n\\n1301\\n00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:05,270\\nThat's 20 not nat.\\n\\n1302\\n00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:10,037\\n- Cool, you start saying\\r\\nthat you begin to see\\n\\n1303\\n00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:15,500\\na thread of umbra going\\r\\ntowards Times Square\\n\\n1304\\n00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:20,050\\nkind of in that weird bridgie way.\\n\\n1305\\n00:56:20,050 --> 00:56:21,870\\nVein is the wrong word,\\n\\n1306\\n00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:24,080\\nit's more like how currents\\r\\nexist in the ocean.\\n\\n1307\\n00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,917\\nThere's a current of umbra,\\n\\n1308\\n00:56:25,917 --> 00:56:26,930\\n(imitates current)\\n\\n1309\\n00:56:26,930 --> 00:56:30,363\\nmoving towards Times Square.\\n\\n1310\\n00:56:31,470 --> 00:56:33,460\\nAnd you feel somewhat invisible.\\n\\n1311\\n00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,293\\nHere's the thing.\\n\\n1312\\n00:56:34,293 --> 00:56:35,470\\nAnd I'm going to ask Pete\\n\\n1313\\n00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:39,860\\nfor this lie to work\\r\\nlike a lot of good lies.\\n\\n1314\\n00:56:39,860 --> 00:56:41,690\\nPart of you has to believe it.\\n\\n1315\\n00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:44,690\\nIs Pete willing to let\\r\\nhimself get to a point\\n\\n1316\\n00:56:44,690 --> 00:56:48,090\\nof feeling a little bit of\\r\\nisolation in this moment\\n\\n1317\\n00:56:48,090 --> 00:56:49,783\\nto make the lie convincing.\\n\\n1318\\n00:56:57,130 --> 00:57:00,300\\n- I mean, he's definitely\\r\\nsaying all of this stuff\\n\\n1319\\n00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,040\\nknowing he doesn't believe it.\\n\\n1320\\n00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:06,220\\nBut I do believe he is pretty isolated.\\n\\n1321\\n00:57:06,220 --> 00:57:10,060\\n- If Pete feels a twang of isolation,\\n\\n1322\\n00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:12,860\\nthen the lie will work,\\n\\n1323\\n00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:15,783\\nbut you have to feel the\\r\\nreal feeling of loneliness.\\n\\n1324\\n00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:18,640\\n- Yeah, I think he does.\\n\\n1325\\n00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:21,320\\nI think he definitely has\\r\\naccess to that feeling.\\n\\n1326\\n00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,153\\n- Okay, cool.\\n\\n1327\\n00:57:22,153 --> 00:57:23,493\\nThat is a trigger for Pete.\\n\\n1328\\n00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:27,303\\n- Four.\\n\\n1329\\n00:57:27,303 --> 00:57:28,136\\n- Cool. Great.\\n\\n1330\\n00:57:28,136 --> 00:57:29,030\\n- Yes.\\n\\n1331\\n00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:33,510\\n- You move forward, as\\r\\nyou say that you feel\\n\\n1332\\n00:57:33,510 --> 00:57:35,757\\nthat real thing of you're like,\\n\\n1333\\n00:57:35,757 --> 00:57:38,677\\n\\\"I'm living in a fucking\\r\\nattic in Astoria.\\\"\\n\\n1334\\n00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:48,920\\nYou know that Priya didn't\\r\\ntreat you correctly.\\n\\n1335\\n00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:53,830\\nAnd you know, the kindness\\r\\nthat Sofia and Kingston\\n\\n1336\\n00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:57,300\\nand Ricky and everybody\\r\\nhas extended to you.\\n\\n1337\\n00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,763\\nYou know that kindness is incredibly real.\\n\\n1338\\n00:58:00,790 --> 00:58:04,400\\nAnd the realness of that\\r\\nkindness makes it hurt even more.\\n\\n1339\\n00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,160\\nThat these people are\\r\\nnot going to lie down\\n\\n1340\\n00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,020\\nin bed with you to keep you warm at night\\n\\n1341\\n00:58:09,020 --> 00:58:10,630\\nfor the rest of your life.\\n\\n1342\\n00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:14,460\\nThey're not going to be there\\r\\nby your side at every moment\\n\\n1343\\n00:58:14,460 --> 00:58:17,430\\nthey are going to have their\\r\\nown needs and their own lives.\\n\\n1344\\n00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:21,400\\nAnd for as awful as Priya was to you\\n\\n1345\\n00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,890\\nas much as things were never going to work\\n\\n1346\\n00:58:22,890 --> 00:58:26,597\\nout with Rowan, you weren't alone.\\n\\n1347\\n00:58:26,597 --> 00:58:29,400\\n(somber music)\\n\\n1348\\n00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:33,870\\nAnd that when you feel isolated\\r\\nand you feel this feeling\\n\\n1349\\n00:58:33,870 --> 00:58:38,870\\nof like so sad, so alone, cold.\\n\\n1350\\n00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:43,430\\nAnd cold is a measurement\\r\\nof distance almost.\\n\\n1351\\n00:58:43,430 --> 00:58:44,800\\nYou're further away.\\n\\n1352\\n00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:46,990\\nThe more farther away\\r\\nthings move from each other,\\n\\n1353\\n00:58:46,990 --> 00:58:48,380\\nthe colder they get,\\n\\n1354\\n00:58:48,380 --> 00:58:50,870\\ndown to the level of electrons, right?\\n\\n1355\\n00:58:50,870 --> 00:58:52,340\\nThe air is moving less.\\n\\n1356\\n00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:54,780\\nThings are less agitated\\r\\nwhen they're further apart\\n\\n1357\\n00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:56,120\\nand colder and more distant.\\n\\n1358\\n00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:59,370\\nAnd as you hear that, something's wrong\\n\\n1359\\n00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:00,250\\nwith the colorful signs.\\n\\n1360\\n00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:01,750\\nYou're in Times Square\\n\\n1361\\n00:59:02,610 --> 00:59:06,470\\nand you look and see\\r\\nthrough the colorful signs\\n\\n1362\\n00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:10,530\\nand all of these things\\r\\nare billboards of signs\\n\\n1363\\n00:59:10,530 --> 00:59:13,860\\nand products that don't exist,\\n\\n1364\\n00:59:13,860 --> 00:59:15,840\\nall the signs in Times Square Nod are\\n\\n1365\\n00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:19,000\\nfor companies that people in\\r\\nthe city dream of starting.\\n\\n1366\\n00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:21,650\\nSo there's all these dreams of people\\n\\n1367\\n00:59:21,650 --> 00:59:23,530\\nthat are trying to make it in music.\\n\\n1368\\n00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:26,250\\nAnd haven't made it yet and\\r\\ntrying to sell their movie\\n\\n1369\\n00:59:26,250 --> 00:59:28,790\\nand be an action star and\\r\\nthis person, that person.\\n\\n1370\\n00:59:28,790 --> 00:59:33,650\\nSo it's an incredible neon thing\\r\\nof all the dreams and ideas\\n\\n1371\\n00:59:33,650 --> 00:59:35,370\\nand innovations of people\\r\\nand what they want to do\\n\\n1372\\n00:59:35,370 --> 00:59:36,243\\nwith their lives.\\n\\n1373\\n00:59:37,380 --> 00:59:40,530\\nThere is an area as you look,\\n\\n1374\\n00:59:40,530 --> 00:59:43,570\\nand at first you think\\r\\nsomething's wrong with your eyes\\n\\n1375\\n00:59:43,570 --> 00:59:45,730\\nbecause you're looking\\r\\nat some of the signs\\n\\n1376\\n00:59:45,730 --> 00:59:47,673\\nand they are absent of color.\\n\\n1377\\n00:59:48,790 --> 00:59:50,640\\nAnd then you realize that\\n\\n1378\\n00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:56,648\\nyou are seeing the absence of color\\n\\n1379\\n00:59:56,648 --> 00:59:58,440\\n(dramatic music)\\n\\n1380\\n00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:02,466\\nin the silhouette of a\\r\\nfigure wearing a suit.\\n\\n1381\\n01:00:02,466 --> 01:00:03,357\\n(dramatic music)\\n\\n1382\\n01:00:03,357 --> 01:00:05,258\\n- It's a person.\\n\\n1383\\n01:00:05,258 --> 01:00:07,860\\n- The way I would describe\\r\\nit is picture if...\\n\\n1384\\n01:00:07,860 --> 01:00:10,280\\nLike, you know when someone is invisible\\n\\n1385\\n01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:12,590\\nyou're able to see through them.\\n\\n1386\\n01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:14,590\\nPicture if someone was invisible\\n\\n1387\\n01:00:14,590 --> 01:00:16,020\\nand you could see through them\\n\\n1388\\n01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:17,720\\nbut everything that you were seeing\\n\\n1389\\n01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:20,650\\nthrough them to see was\\r\\nrobbed of its color.\\n\\n1390\\n01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,340\\nSo there's no features to this thing.\\n\\n1391\\n01:00:22,340 --> 01:00:23,480\\nThere's no outline.\\n\\n1392\\n01:00:23,480 --> 01:00:28,480\\nIt's just the shape of\\r\\nsomething human like\\n\\n1393\\n01:00:29,630 --> 01:00:32,267\\nwith the things behind\\r\\nit, robbed of color.\\n\\n1394\\n01:00:32,267 --> 01:00:35,017\\n(dramatic music)\\n\\n1395\\n01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:38,843\\n- Can I cast detect thoughts on it?\\n\\n1396\\n01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:41,498\\n- Static?\\n\\n1397\\n01:00:41,498 --> 01:00:44,248\\n(dramatic music)\\n\\n1398\\n01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:51,703\\nYou see the figure turn to

01:00:59,990\\nbecause it isn't a figure.\\n\\n1402\\n01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:02,110\\nIt's just things in the distance\\n\\n1403\\n01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:05,000\\nnot having the color they\\r\\nwould normally have, right?\\n\\n1404\\n01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,930\\nSo it's like, where is this\\r\\nthing in relation to me..\\n\\n1405\\n01:01:06,930 --> 01:01:09,010\\nBut in terms of the size of something\\n\\n1406\\n01:01:09,010 --> 01:01:12,730\\nit would make sense if\\r\\nsomething was not close\\n\\n1407\\n01:01:12,730 --> 01:01:15,050\\nbut not far away, maybe something like...\\n\\n1408\\n01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:17,750\\nLike if a person was in the\\r\\nmiddle distance between you\\n\\n1409\\n01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:22,750\\nand sign behind it turns,\\r\\nyou hear a

goes,\\n\\n1414\\n01:01:44,877 --> 01:01:49,137\\n\\\"Wow, look at all these dreams.\\\"\\n\\n1415\\n01:01:51,190 --> 01:01:55,150\\nThe head of the figure turns\\r\\nand again, there's no face\\n\\n1416\\n01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:56,700\\nbut the head turns in\\r\\nsuch a way that you know\\n\\n1417\\n01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:59,888\\nit is oriented towards you and just goes,\\n\\n1418\\n01:01:59,888 --> 01:02:03,258\\n(dramatic music)\\n\\n1419\\n01:02:03,258 --> 01:02:04,905\\n\\\"Most of these will never come true.\\n\\n1420\\n01:02:04,905 -->

true.\\n\\n1425\\n01:02:22,860 --> 01:02:24,790\\n- The invisible person--\\n\\n1426\\n01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:25,970\\n- Hasn't spoken, it was just--\\n\\n1427\\n01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:29,580\\n- Hasn't spoken, it's a voice\\r\\ncoming out of your phone\\n\\n1428\\n01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:31,343\\nbut you're not sure.\\n\\n1429\\n01:02:32,530 --> 01:02:34,500\\nThere is no person there.\\n\\n1430\\n01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:38,130\\nAnd so maybe this person doesn't talk\\n\\n1431\\n01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:41,740\\nfrom a place because it is nowhere.\\n\\n1432\\n01:02:41,740 -->

01:12:37,800\\nAs there is within most\\r\\ncities, but no, it's...\\n\\n1644\\n01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:42,610\\nYeah, magic's different\\r\\ndepending on where you go,\\n\\n1645\\n01:12:42,610 --> 01:12:46,592\\nNew York is unique,\\r\\nunique New York, right?\\\"\\n\\n1646\\n01:12:46,592 --> 01:12:47,425\\n- Yeah.\\n\\n1647\\n01:12:48,828 --> 01:12:49,833\\nThat rolled off the tongue for

get into much theater.\\n\\n1651\\n01:12:56,040 --> 01:12:57,823\\nI mostly was getting my ass kicked.\\n\\n1652\\n01:12:59,196 --> 01:13:03,330\\nBut I'll tell you what the...\\n\\n1653\\n01:13:03,330 --> 01:13:06,670\\nNo, San Francisco's got a magic all it's own.\\n\\n1654\\n01:13:06,670 --> 01:13:10,120\\nAnd I have family out there\\n\\n1655\\n01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:11,830\\nso I wanted to see them.\\n\\n1656\\n01:13:11,830 --> 01:13:13,020\\nAnd I also wanted the order that...\\n\\n1657\\n01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:17,000\\nYou know, there was a period of time\\n\\n1658\\n01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,000\\nin American history where\\r\\nthey were going to have...\\n\\n1659\\n01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:27,100\\nThey got the Statue of\\r\\nLiberty out here in New York.\\n\\n1660\\n01:13:27,430 --> 01:13:29,520\\nAnd in San Francisco\\n\\n1661\\n01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:31,637\\nthey wanted to build a\\r\\ncomplimentary statute to it\\n\\n1662\\n01:13:31,637 --> 01:13:33,740\\ncalled the Statue of Responsibility.\\n\\n1663\\n01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:34,573\\nIt's a interesting piece of history.\\n\\n1664\\n01:13:34,573 --> 01:13:35,673\\nYou can look it up.\\n\\n1665\\n01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:40,560\\nI think people forget that sometimes.\\n\\n1666\\n01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,630\\nAnd I wonder what the country would be\\n\\n1667\\n01:13:42,630 --> 01:13:45,240\\nlike if we had had both\\r\\nstatutes kind of watching\\n\\n1668\\n01:13:45,240 --> 01:13:47,160\\nout for us on either coast.\\n\\n1669\\n01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:51,120\\nBecause it's not always\\r\\nabout what you want to do,\\n\\n1670\\n01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:54,300\\nsometimes it's about\\r\\nyour responsibilities.\\n\\n1671\\n01:13:54,300 --> 01:13:55,810\\n- Yeah, I see.\\n\\n1672\\n01:13:55,810 --> 01:13:59,180\\nOh, you know, as a fellow,\\r\\na monk of the order\\n\\n1673\\n01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:01,030\\ndealing with the material world\\n\\n1674\\n01:14:01,030 --> 01:14:03,850\\nand really ingrained\\r\\nin that kind of stuff.\\n\\n1675\\n01:14:03,850 --> 01:14:04,720\\nI totally agree.\\n\\n1676\\n01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,500\\nResponsibility is really important.\\n\\n1677\\n01:14:06,500 --> 01:14:07,765\\nIt's really important.\\n\\n1678\\n01:14:07,765 --> 01:14:09,730\\n- Yeah, you know that's the mantra, right?\\n\\n1679\\n01:14:09,730 --> 01:14:11,960\\nIt is what it is and--\\n\\n1680\\n01:14:11,960 --> 01:14:14,527\\n- Yeah, it is what it is.\\n\\n1681\\n01:14:14,527 --> 01:14:17,623\\nAbsolutely, I think that's a great mantra.\\n\\n1682\\n01:14:17,623 --> 01:14:20,493\\n- (laughs) You see, Tony\\r\\nlooks at you and says,\\n\\n1683\\n01:14:23,287 --> 01:14:25,650\\n\\\"In any case, no there's no Vox Populi,\\n\\n1684\\n01:14:25,650 --> 01:14:27,630\\nVox Phantasma there.\\\"\\n\\n1685\\n01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:30,560\\nNew, New York is a special in terms\\n\\n1686\\n01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:35,313\\nof its relationship to the\\r\\ncycle of waking and dreaming.\\n\\n1687\\n01:14:36,550 --> 01:14:38,950\\nIt has a unique relationship to sleep,\\n\\n1688\\n01:14:38,950 --> 01:14:39,950\\nto the world of dreaming.\\n\\n1689\\n01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:42,730\\nBut there's plenty of other\\r\\nrealms to be attached to,\\n\\n1690\\n01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:44,520\\nplenty of other sources of magic out there\\n\\n1691\\n01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,487\\nand other places.\\\"\\n\\n1692\\n01:14:47,300 --> 01:14:48,890\\n- Okay, I was just curious.\\n\\n1693\\n01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:51,760\\n'Cause I know that we have a\\r\\nreal reciprocal relationship\\n\\n1694\\n01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:55,650\\nwith magic and the material.\\n\\n1695\\n01:14:57,640 --> 01:14:59,990\\nWe have a good relationship between,\\n\\n1696\\n01:14:59,990 --> 01:15:02,960\\nmaybe Liberty and responsibility here.\\n\\n1697\\n01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,570\\nAnd so I was curious.\\n\\n1698\\n01:15:05,570 --> 01:15:08,233\\n- Yeah, it's not really magic what we do.\\n\\n1699\\n01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:10,713\\n- No, it's not.\\n\\n1700\\n01:15:11,690 --> 01:15:14,860\\n- The power of your strength,\\r\\nyour ki, your soul.\\n\\n1701\\n01:15:14,860 --> 01:15:16,150\\nKi is literally life force.\\n\\n1702\\n01:15:16,150 --> 01:15:20,100\\nIt's not supernatural, it's\\r\\nthe most natural, right?\\n\\n1703\\n01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:24,290\\nAnd even people that cast spells\\n\\n1704\\n01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:30,090\\nwith the best of intentions\\r\\ncan sometimes be meddling\\n\\n1705\\n01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:32,200\\nin forces that they\\r\\ndon't fully understand.\\n\\n1706\\n01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:33,033\\nYou know what I mean?\\n\\n1707\\n01:15:33,033 --> 01:15:35,050\\nAnd I'm not gonna lie to you Sofia,\\n\\n1708\\n01:15:35,050 --> 01:15:39,630\\nlook, I think, you know\\r\\nthat I'm an old school guy.\\n\\n1709\\n01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:42,233\\nI feel old school kind\\r\\nof way about things.\\n\\n1710\\n01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:45,380\\nThe last thing I want\\r\\nto do is be an old dog\\n\\n1711\\n01:15:45,380 --> 01:15:46,753\\ntrying to learn new tricks.\\n\\n1712\\n01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:50,610\\nAnd I don't want to be that\\r\\nasshole that comes back home\\n\\n1713\\n01:15:50,610 --> 01:15:53,900\\nand tries to tell people the\\r\\nway to do things or whatever.\\n\\n1714\\n01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:56,920\\nLook, hey, you crack the riddle, right?\\n\\n1715\\n01:15:56,920 --> 01:15:58,190\\nTurns out Dale was right,\\n\\n1716\\n01:15:58,190 --> 01:15:59,870\\nthe chosen one was a real thing, right?\\n\\n1717\\n01:15:59,870 --> 01:16:03,303\\nSo I'm not going to\\r\\ntell you your business.\\n\\n1718\\n01:16:05,540 --> 01:16:08,653\\nWhat I will say is that\\r\\nit's a slippery slope.\\n\\n1719\\n01:16:10,310 --> 01:16:11,500\\nIt's a slippery slope,\\n\\n1720\\n01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,860\\nbecause of course haste\\r\\nis going to be useful.\\n\\n1721\\n01:16:14,860 --> 01:16:16,370\\nOf course, it's going to\\r\\nbe useful for someone to\\n\\n1722\\n01:16:16,370 --> 01:16:20,130\\nsummon some kind of\\r\\nspirit, do something quick.\\n\\n1723\\n01:16:20,130 --> 01:16:22,030\\nSo you let it slide, right?\\n\\n1724\\n01:16:22,030 --> 01:16:23,780\\nAnd that's a little more,\\n\\n1725\\n01:16:23,780 --> 01:16:25,360\\nit's a creature from the dream realm\\n\\n1726\\n01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:26,500\\nis something crossing over,\\n\\n1727\\n01:16:26,500 --> 01:16:27,483\\nis something else.\\n\\n1728\\n01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:32,900\\nEventually the line gets drawn somewhere.\\n\\n1729\\n01:16:32,900 --> 01:16:37,290\\nAnd if it doesn't well, what\\r\\nthe hell happens then, right?\\n\\n1730\\n01:16:39,428 --> 01:16:44,428\\n- Yeah, I definitely agree that it's\\n\\n1731\\n01:16:44,487 --> 01:16:49,047\\na delicate situation and that\\r\\nresponsibility is important.\\n\\n1732\\n01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:52,320\\nI do hope that you will keep an open mind\\n\\n1733\\n01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:55,498\\nbecause I do believe an old\\r\\ndog can learn new tricks.\\n\\n1734\\n01:16:55,498 --> 01:16:59,310\\n- Hey, I'll do my best, I'm pretty old.\\n\\n1735\\n01:16:59,310 --> 01:17:00,890\\n- Okay, yeah. All right.\\n\\n1736\\n01:17:00,890 --> 01:17:05,240\\nCool, and I think that I feel okay\\n\\n1737\\n01:17:05,240 --> 01:17:07,610\\nwith that conversation,\\n\\n1738\\n01:17:07,610 --> 01:17:10,920\\nkind of feel like I suss\\r\\nhim out a little more.\\n\\n1739\\n01:17:10,920 --> 01:17:13,070\\nI was considering spying on him.\\n\\n1740\\n01:17:13,070 --> 01:17:15,630\\nObviously, I don't say this out loud\\n\\n1741\\n01:17:15,630 --> 01:17:19,533\\nbut I think I'm going\\r\\nto just keep it as is.\\n\\n1742\\n01:17:20,620 --> 01:17:25,203\\n- Cool, the meeting comes.\\n\\n1743\\n01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:32,100\\nSo Esther arrives with JJ in tow\\n\\n1744\\n01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:34,980\\nbecause Ana and Amelia are asleep.\\n\\n1745\\n01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:35,830\\nIt's the daytime.\\n\\n1746\\n01:17:37,267 --> 01:17:39,810\\nSo she arrives looking great.\\n\\n1747\\n01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:41,380\\nShe's there with Ricky.\\n\\n1748\\n01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:42,980\\nIga you get there.\\n\\n1749\\n01:17:42,980 --> 01:17:44,980\\nYou guys all meet up at the ferry.\\n\\n1750\\n01:17:44,980 --> 01:17:49,600\\nYou see Willy walking up, come, come.\\n\\n1751\\n01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,170\\nGive me a perception check.\\n\\n1752\\n01:17:51,170 --> 01:17:52,463\\n- You got it.\\n\\n1753\\n01:17:54,460 --> 01:17:56,203\\nThat's going to be 18.\\n\\n1754\\n01:17:57,720 --> 01:18:02,273\\n- Willy is moving a little\\r\\nbit slower than normal.\\n\\n1755\\n01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:07,070\\n- Can I tell why or is there...\\n\\n1756\\n01:18:07,070 --> 01:18:08,690\\nCan I tell why without asking?\\n\\n1757\\n01:18:08,690 --> 01:18:10,540\\n- Give me a medicine check.\\n\\n1758\\n01:18:10,540 --> 01:18:11,373\\n- I'd love too.\\n\\n1759\\n01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:14,863\\n- That's going to be a 28.\\n\\n1760\\n01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:19,840\\n- Willy is a Golem.\\n\\n1761\\n01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:24,840\\nHe is animated by a divine\\r\\nforce and it looks like,\\n\\n1762\\n01:18:25,210 --> 01:18:28,420\\nthat maybe his connection\\n\\n1763\\n01:18:28,420 --> 01:18:31,570\\nto that divine force\\r\\nis a little bit weaker.\\n\\n1764\\n01:18:31,570 --> 01:18:33,120\\nA little bit lessened.\\n\\n1765\\n01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:36,280\\nIt looks like he's straining\\r\\nmore to move his own bulk\\n\\n1766\\n01:18:36,280 --> 01:18:38,620\\nbut he looks up at you and\\r\\nyou can tell he's masking it.\\n\\n1767\\n01:18:38,620 --> 01:18:42,210\\nHe just goes, \\\"Kingston Brown from uptown,\\n\\n1768\\n01:18:42,210 --> 01:18:43,460\\nthere's my buddy.\\\"\\n\\n1769\\n01:18:44,873 --> 01:18:46,293\\n- A big old hug.\\n\\n1770\\n01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:48,940\\nHey, thank you so much for coming out.\\n\\n1771\\n01:18:48,940 --> 01:18:52,470\\nThis should be good to get off the Island\\n\\n1772\\n01:18:52,470 --> 01:18:54,370\\ngo see what Staten Island's all about.\\n\\n1773\\n01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:56,333\\nI agree.\\n\\n1774\\n01:18:56,333 --> 01:18:58,455\\n(Emily laughing)\\n\\n1775\\n01:18:58,455 --> 01:19:03,455\\n- You guys, so it's Willy,\\r\\nLowell Masters who shows up.\\n\\n1776\\n01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:05,463\\nWho's also moving slowly.\\n\\n1777\\n01:19:08,475 --> 01:19:11,050\\n(Emily laughing)\\n\\n1778\\n01:19:11,050 --> 01:19:14,669\\nEsther and JJ, JJ can see Willy and his...\\n\\n1779\\n01:19:14,669 --> 01:19:17,670\\nHe's like, \\\"Holy, shnike's dude, this guy.\\n\\n1780\\n01:19:17,670 --> 01:19:18,690\\nLook at this dude.\\n\\n1781\\n01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:20,457\\nThis is wild man.\\\"\\n\\n1782\\n01:19:22,340 --> 01:19:27,250\\nAnd you guys all get on\\r\\nthe Staten Island ferry,\\n\\n1783\\n01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:29,220\\nPete this is the morning you woke up.\\n\\n1784\\n01:19:29,220 --> 01:19:32,093\\nSo you get there right as the\\r\\nferry is about to take off.\\n\\n1785\\n01:19:33,040 --> 01:19:35,870\\nSo you see a Madame Anastasia ,\\n\\n1786\\n01:19:35,870 --> 01:19:38,550\\nRicky, Esther, JJ, Willy, Kingston\\n\\n1787\\n01:19:38,550 --> 01:19:41,083\\nand Cody all here with Lowell Masters.\\n\\n1788\\n01:19:43,410 --> 01:19:44,740\\nPete, what do you say as you approach?\\n\\n1789\\n01:19:44,740 --> 01:19:47,519\\n- Yeah, I think I just\\r\\ntell everyone everything.\\n\\n1790\\n01:19:47,519 --> 01:19:50,610\\nYeah, especially Kingston,\\n\\n1791\\n01:19:50,610 --> 01:19:54,850\\nI'm just talking about how it was\\n\\n1792\\n01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:56,710\\ntaking dreams away.\\n\\n1793\\n01:19:56,710 --> 01:19:59,540\\nIt seemed to be a lot of...\\n\\n1794\\n01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:03,270\\nLike it was just subtracting\\r\\nsomething from the city\\n\\n1795\\n01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:04,810\\nor something from the people\\n\\n1796\\n01:20:04,810 --> 01:20:07,193\\nand that it's only banished.\\n\\n1797\\n01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:11,720\\n- Oh, well that doesn't sound good at all.\\n\\n1798\\n01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:13,583\\n- Did you tell us the Gladiator part?\\n\\n1799\\n01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:15,490\\n- No. Yeah, yeah.\\n\\n1800\\n01:20:15,490 --> 01:20:16,640\\nI'll tell you that part too.\\n\\n1801\\n01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:19,133\\nAnd about finding Nod.\\n\\n1802\\n01:20:20,380 --> 01:20:21,213\\nWait, sorry.\\n\\n1803\\n01:20:21,213 --> 01:20:25,180\\nThe Gladiator part was at the\\r\\nend, right before I woke up.\\n\\n1804\\n01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:28,910\\n- The two signs in Times\\r\\nSquare that had been shut off\\n\\n1805\\n01:20:28,910 --> 01:20:31,510\\nwhich literally you understand.\\n\\n1806\\n01:20:31,510 --> 01:20:33,680\\nYou understand in waking what that means\\n\\n1807\\n01:20:33,680 --> 01:20:35,670\\nbecause Times Square and Nod is made up\\n\\n1808\\n01:20:35,670 --> 01:20:38,300\\nof everybody's dreams and ambitions\\n\\n1809\\n01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:39,640\\nand desires for the future.\\n\\n1810\\n01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:43,430\\nWhen signs disappear like\\r\\nthat, it means somebody\\n\\n1811\\n01:20:43,430 --> 01:20:46,513\\nin the waking world fully\\r\\ngave up on that dream.\\n\\n1812\\n01:20:47,410 --> 01:20:49,163\\nIt died in them.\\n\\n1813\\n01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:55,560\\n- So then I saw a Gladiator come back on.\\n\\n1814\\n01:20:55,560 --> 01:20:56,800\\n- Yep.\\n\\n1815\\n01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:57,633\\n- Got it. Yeah.\\n\\n1816\\n01:20:57,633 --> 01:20:58,653\\nI let everyone know that.\\n\\n1817\\n01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:01,390\\nEspecially Cody.\\r\\n- This is all adding up.\\n\\n1818\\n01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:02,223\\nI'm like, yeah.\\n\\n1819\\n01:21:02,223 --> 01:21:04,060\\n- This is super adding up.\\n\\n1820\\n01:21:04,060 --> 01:21:07,300\\n- Wait, I want to ask JJ\\r\\nsomething for a second.\\n\\n1821\\n01:21:07,300 --> 01:21:08,750\\n- Yeah. Go for it.\\n\\n1822\\n01:21:08,750 --> 01:21:12,097\\n- JJ, I remember you and Esther talking.\\n\\n1823\\n01:21:12,097 --> 01:21:17,097\\nYou are at Columbia and you\\r\\nfound a particle in science.\\n\\n1824\\n01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:20,703\\nThat was literally magic.\\n\\n1825\\n01:21:21,720 --> 01:21:24,823\\n- Yes, it was pretty wild man.\\n\\n1826\\n01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:30,660\\nSo it has to do with the\\r\\nphysics of space time.\\n\\n1827\\n01:21:30,660 --> 01:21:32,720\\nAnd basically,\\n\\n1828\\n01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:37,720\\nthere is a particle\\n\\n1829\\n01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:41,120\\nwithin the understanding of science.\\n\\n1830\\n01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:44,134\\nYou see JJ looks at Ricky already like...\\n\\n1831\\n01:21:44,134 --> 01:21:46,480\\nHe's like, \\\"Okay, so\\r\\nbasically it's this,\\\" right?\\n\\n1832\\n01:21:46,480 --> 01:21:49,080\\nNothing can move faster than\\r\\nthe speed of light, right?\\n\\n1833\\n01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:51,150\\nSpeed of light is the\\r\\nfastest thing in the world.\\n\\n1834\\n01:21:51,150 --> 01:21:52,930\\nAnd as long as this thing is like,\\n\\n1835\\n01:21:52,930 --> 01:21:54,810\\ntheoretically you could time travel\\n\\n1836\\n01:21:54,810 --> 01:21:56,760\\nand like go back to the past.\\n\\n1837\\n01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:58,020\\nBut in order to do that\\n\\n1838\\n01:21:58,020 --> 01:22:00,250\\nyou'd have to move faster\\r\\nthan the speed of light\\n\\n1839\\n01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:02,090\\nand nothing can move fast\\r\\nin the speed of light.\\\"\\n\\n1840\\n01:22:02,090 --> 01:22:03,650\\nThere's whole bunch of\\r\\nrelative reasons for that.\\n\\n1841\\n01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:05,680\\nBut it's this weird thing where,\\n\\n1842\\n01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,590\\nif you ever heard that light\\r\\nmoves both like a particle\\n\\n1843\\n01:22:07,590 --> 01:22:08,423\\nand a wave.\\n\\n1844\\n01:22:08,423 --> 01:22:11,000\\nIt behaves sort of like\\r\\nboth in weird ways.\\n\\n1845\\n01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:12,211\\n- Have I heard that?\\n\\n1846\\n01:22:12,211 --> 01:22:15,199\\n(participants laughing)\\n\\n1847\\n01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:16,616\\nWell, yeah, sure.\\n\\n1848\\n01:22:20,715 --> 01:22:25,417\\n- So there is an element in terms of time\\n\\n1849\\n01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:32,290\\nthere are elements of time that exist\\n\\n1850\\n01:22:32,290 --> 01:22:36,480\\nin kind of measurable\\r\\nspace that we can quantify\\n\\n1851\\n01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:38,000\\nand kind of understand.\\n\\n1852\\n01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,810\\nBut in terms of relativity\\n\\n1853\\n01:22:39,810 --> 01:22:42,210\\nthey change in certain instances, right?\\n\\n1854\\n01:22:42,210 --> 01:22:45,320\\nBut when you get into\\r\\nstudying quantum mechanics,\\n\\n1855\\n01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:46,420\\nthe whole thing with quantum mechanics\\n\\n1856\\n01:22:46,420 --> 01:22:48,520\\nis a thing can break rules.\\n\\n1857\\n01:22:48,520 --> 01:22:52,620\\nIt can be in two places at the\\r\\nsame time, the rules of kind\\n\\n1858\\n01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:55,230\\nof macro physics and the rules\\r\\nof quantum physics differ.\\n\\n1859\\n01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:57,510\\nSo we don't have a united\\r\\ntheory of physics, right?\\n\\n1860\\n01:22:57,510 --> 01:22:59,130\\nSo I'm sorry.\\n\\n1861\\n01:22:59,130 --> 01:23:00,480\\nI feel like I'm messing up.\\n\\n1862\\n01:23:02,700 --> 01:23:05,760\\n- It seems like you're\\r\\ntalking about stuff that...\\n\\n1863\\n01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:07,333\\nWell, generally my question.\\n\\n1864\\n01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:11,333\\nDid anyone find your research?\\n\\n1865\\n01:23:12,260 --> 01:23:13,250\\n- Oh yeah.\\n\\n1866\\n01:23:15,092 --> 01:23:15,925\\nWell, I sent it in\\n\\n1867\\n01:23:15,925 --> 01:23:18,620\\nbecause I applied for an\\r\\ninternship at Gladiator.\\n\\n1868\\n01:23:18,620 --> 01:23:23,620\\nSo I sent it in to them, but is that...\\n\\n1869\\n01:23:26,270 --> 01:23:27,110\\nWhat's up?\\n\\n1870\\n01:23:27,110 --> 01:23:29,047\\nWhy is everyone's sighing?\\n\\n1871\\n01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:34,182\\n- I played \\\"Soul Caliber\\\" with you, dude.\\n\\n1872\\n01:23:34,182 --> 01:23:38,310\\n(participants laughing)\\n\\n1873\\n01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:40,020\\n- Dude, they just pay super well.\\n\\n1874\\n01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:43,844\\nI got the cool thing of Columbia.\\n\\n1875\\n01:23:43,844 --> 01:23:45,640\\nI wasn't gonna work there forever,\\n\\n1876\\n01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:47,170\\nbut like it's a huge thing on your resume.\\n\\n1877\\n01:23:47,170 --> 01:23:48,110\\nIf you can...\\n\\n1878\\n01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:49,563\\nI didn't mean to fuck up.\\n\\n1879\\n01:23:51,202 --> 01:23:53,860\\nYou see he says, look, there's a...\\n\\n1880\\n01:23:53,860 --> 01:23:57,110\\nEsther stands up for JJ\\r\\nand says, \\\"JJ didn't know\\n\\n1881\\n01:23:57,110 --> 01:24:00,860\\nthe magical world was real\\r\\nthree or four days ago.\\n\\n1882\\n01:24:00,860 --> 01:24:04,797\\nSo we're gonna let JJ off\\r\\nthe hook on this one.\\\"\\n\\n1883\\n01:24:06,090 --> 01:24:07,507\\nYou see, JJ goes, \\\"Yeah.\\\"\\n\\n1884\\n01:24:08,700 --> 01:24:10,370\\nLook basically the particle\\n\\n1885\\n01:24:10,370 --> 01:24:11,570\\nis this interesting thing, right?\\n\\n1886\\n01:24:11,570 --> 01:24:16,100\\nBecause it exists where...\\n\\n1887\\n01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:20,130\\nI was studying it in Florida\\r\\nand I couldn't find it.\\n\\n1888\\n01:24:20,130 --> 01:24:22,830\\nIt wasn't there basically, right?\\n\\n1889\\n01:24:22,830 --> 01:24:24,740\\nBut

01:37:41,549\\nDid he start his--\\\"\\n\\n2186\\n01:37:41,549 --> 01:37:42,382\\n(participants laughing)\\n\\n2187\\n01:37:42,382 --> 01:37:43,215\\n- Ricky just nods.\\n\\n2188\\n01:37:43,215 --> 01:37:46,548\\n(participants laughing)\\n\\n2189\\n01:37:47,830 --> 01:37:48,663\\n- You devilish.\\n\\n2190\\n01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:53,850\\n- I started a bunch of\\r\\nclaps, just all the claps.\\n\\n2191\\n01:37:53,850 --> 01:37:55,897\\nSo relax.\\r\\n- You see,\\n\\n2192\\n01:37:55,897 --> 01:38:00,897\\nEsther looks and says, \\\"Not\\r\\nto mention the appearance\\n\\n2193\\n01:38:04,300 --> 01:38:09,300\\nof an infernal codex\\r\\nitself in a hot topic.\\\"\\n\\n2194\\n01:38:10,720 --> 01:38:12,357\\nYou see that JJ speaks up and says,\\n\\n2195\\n01:38:12,357 --> 01:38:16,170\\n\\\"Honestly, I feel I've\\r\\nseen infernal codexes\\n\\n2196\\n01:38:16,170 --> 01:38:18,200\\nin hot topics before.\\\"\\n\\n2197\\n01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:19,900\\nAnd Esther goes, \\\"Right in this case,\\n\\n2198\\n01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:21,697\\na real one, which is noteworthy.\\\"\\n\\n2199\\n01:38:24,080 --> 01:38:29,080\\nShe says, \\\"Additionally,\\r\\nwe have Lowell Masters here\\n\\n2200\\n01:38:30,250 --> 01:38:33,180\\nwho should be here in a minute or two.\\n\\n2201\\n01:38:33,180 --> 01:38:35,217\\nHe's in the bathroom at the moment.\\\"\\n\\n2202\\n01:38:38,866 --> 01:38:41,596\\n- My mother, what she would say to me.\\n\\n2203\\n01:38:41,596 --> 01:38:45,260\\n(participants laughing)\\n\\n2204\\n01:38:45,260 --> 01:38:49,323\\n- Incredible, you see\\r\\nLowell Masters walks in.\\n\\n2205\\n01:38:50,276 --> 01:38:52,420\\nIga, it looks like honestly,\\n\\n2206\\n01:38:52,420 --> 01:38:55,350\\nsome incredible restoration\\r\\nwork has happened on this chest.\\n\\n2207\\n01:38:55,350 --> 01:38:56,963\\nIt looks to me incredible shape.\\n\\n2208\\n01:38:58,460 --> 01:39:00,433\\nLowell has really taken care of it.\\n\\n2209\\n01:39:02,350 --> 01:39:03,183\\nYou see that it's\\n\\n2210\\n01:39:03,183 --> 01:39:07,400\\non a small trolley table\\r\\nwith some flowers around it.\\n\\n2211\\n01:39:07,400 --> 01:39:09,640\\nSome incense burning, brings it in.\\n\\n2212\\n01:39:09,640 --> 01:39:12,293\\nHe goes, \\\"Hello everyone.\\n\\n2213\\n01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:17,850\\nSo we did a deep 48 hour\\r\\nscan on the chest here.\\n\\n2214\\n01:39:17,850 --> 01:39:20,260\\nSort of understood the\\r\\nmajor things about it\\n\\n2215\\n01:39:20,260 --> 01:39:21,668\\nsort of right away.\\\"\\r\\n- Need to say deep.\\n\\n2216\\n01:39:21,668 --> 01:39:24,660\\n(Emily laughing)\\n\\n2217\\n01:39:24,660 --> 01:39:26,680\\n- Again for everybody here.\\n\\n2218\\n01:39:26,680 --> 01:39:28,030\\nJust want everyone to know,\\n\\n2219\\n01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:32,733\\nthe margin of error on\\r\\nthese identifies is, well,\\n\\n2220\\n01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:39,560\\nwe would have to be, in a\\r\\ntiny fractional percentage\\n\\n2221\\n01:39:39,710 --> 01:39:42,453\\nto not sort of have a\\r\\ndeeper understanding here.\\n\\n2222\\n01:39:44,520 --> 01:39:47,590\\nSo the box appears to have been changed.\\n\\n2223\\n01:39:47,590 --> 01:39:49,950\\nAnd I am happy to report\\r\\nthat these changes\\n\\n2224\\n01:39:49,950 --> 01:39:54,950\\nin the exterior of the box\\r\\nare a reaction of the box\\n\\n2225\\n01:39:55,650 --> 01:39:58,680\\nto a change in its environment.\\n\\n2226\\n01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:03,190\\nFar be it from the city appearing on it...\\n\\n2227\\n01:40:04,890 --> 01:40:07,103\\nThe city and skyscrapers appearing on it.\\n\\n2228\\n01:40:07,103 --> 01:40:09,240\\nAnd you see as he shows you the chest\\n\\n2229\\n01:40:09,240 --> 01:40:14,240\\nthe chest has another\\r\\ncomplimentary set of skyscrapers.\\n\\n2230\\n01:40:14,440 --> 01:40:15,750\\nNow showing\\n\\n2231\\n01:40:17,398 --> 01:40:22,398\\na woman with her hair\\r\\ntied in a scarf and a man\\n\\n2232\\n01:40:22,810 --> 01:40:26,273\\nwith an enormous double-handed\\r\\nsword and a long coat.\\n\\n2233\\n01:40:28,210 --> 01:40:31,187\\n- We are put together, interesting.\\n\\n2234\\n01:40:31,187 --> 01:40:34,260\\n(Emily laughing)\\n\\n2235\\n01:40:34,260 --> 01:40:36,188\\n- Two side of the same coin.\\n\\n2236\\n01:40:36,188 --> 01:40:37,021\\n(participants laughing)\\n\\n2237\\n01:40:37,021 --> 01:40:37,970\\n- You keep on saying that.\\n\\n2238\\n01:40:37,970 --> 01:40:40,900\\nAnd do not know if you know what it means.\\n\\n2239\\n01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:42,560\\n(participants laughing)\\n\\n2240\\n01:40:42,560 --> 01:40:47,067\\n- You see Lowell says, see he says,\\n\\n2241\\n01:40:47,067 --> 01:40:51,500\\n\\\"I want to be very clear\\r\\nto Mrs. Lisowski here\\n\\n2242\\n01:40:52,937 --> 01:40:57,937\\n\\\"that the appearance of a\\r\\ncity skyline on this box,\\n\\n2243\\n01:40:59,427 --> 01:41:04,427\\n\\\"is effectively something\\r\\nalong the lines of\\n\\n2244\\n01:41:05,077 --> 01:41:09,737\\n\\\"perhaps an adaptation,\\r\\nmaybe more correctly put\\n\\n2245\\n01:41:09,737 --> 01:41:12,897\\n\\\"to be an evolution, because the forces\\n\\n2246\\n01:41:12,897 --> 01:41:17,157\\n\\\"that have prompted this\\r\\nallergic reaction of your box,\\n\\n2247\\n01:41:17,157 --> 01:41:20,173\\n\\\"aren't trying to put a city on it.\\n\\n2248\\n01:41:21,097 --> 01:41:23,023\\n\\\"They're trying to erase it.\\n\\n2249\\n01:41:24,187 --> 01:41:26,967\\n\\\"And your box is fighting back.\\\"\\n\\n2250\\n01:41:30,270 --> 01:41:32,750\\n- Okay, that's weird.\\n\\n2251\\n01:41:32,750 --> 01:41:33,583\\n- What's trying to erase--\\r\\n- I mean, certainly\\n\\n2252\\n01:41:33,583 --> 01:41:36,070\\nmy magic has not become less powerful.\\n\\n2253\\n01:41:36,070 --> 01:41:37,683\\nSo they're not winning.\\n\\n2254\\n01:41:40,520 --> 01:41:43,677\\n- You see that the--\\n\\n2255\\n01:41:47,130 --> 01:41:49,100\\n- Is it essentially like a rash\\n\\n2256\\n01:41:49,100 --> 01:41:52,423\\nthat's an immune response\\r\\nto a greater threat.\\n\\n2257\\n01:41:53,490 --> 01:41:55,640\\n- You see Lowell says,\\r\\n\\\"Precisely, exactly.\\n\\n2258\\n01:41:57,040 --> 01:41:59,610\\nThe force at work that has\\r\\nchanged the environment.\\n\\n2259\\n01:41:59,610 --> 01:42:01,760\\nI believe the box is responding\\n\\n2260\\n01:42:01,760 --> 01:42:04,813\\nto the presence of this\\r\\nraw umbra within the city.\\n\\n2261\\n01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:08,660\\nAnd the umbra is seeking out things like\\n\\n2262\\n01:42:08,660 --> 01:42:11,990\\nthe chest that belongs to Mrs. Lisowski\\n\\n2263\\n01:42:11,990 --> 01:42:15,630\\nand objects like these fighting back\\n\\n2264\\n01:42:15,630 --> 01:42:18,500\\nand withstanding is\\r\\nactually preventing the tide\\n\\n2265\\n01:42:18,500 --> 01:42:21,093\\nfrom destroying or erasing even more.\\n\\n2266\\n01:42:23,860 --> 01:42:28,860\\nSo this chest right now,\\r\\nif I'm being honest...\\n\\n2267\\n01:42:29,470 --> 01:42:33,237\\nYou see that Esther stands up, she says,\\n\\n2268\\n01:42:33,237 --> 01:42:35,370\\n\\\"Can you tell us more about\\r\\nthe nature of the chest?\\\"\\n\\n2269\\n01:42:35,370 --> 01:42:40,370\\nAnd he says, \\\"Absolutely,\\r\\nincredibly powerful magic\\n\\n2270\\n01:42:41,030 --> 01:42:44,280\\nof all eight schools of magic.\\n\\n2271\\n01:42:44,280 --> 01:42:45,163\\nEvery single one.\\n\\n2272\\n01:42:46,020 --> 01:42:51,020\\nThere are thematic\\r\\nassociations within this,\\n\\n2273\\n01:42:51,910 --> 01:42:56,803\\nwith legend, myth, stories,\\n\\n2274\\n01:42:57,730 --> 01:43:02,730\\nand particularly history and time itself.\\\"\\n\\n2275\\n01:43:07,960 --> 01:43:12,620\\nKingston as you hear this, go ahead\\n\\n2276\\n01:43:12,620 --> 01:43:15,900\\nand give me a perception or insight roll.\\n\\n2277\\n01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:16,733\\n- You got it.\\n\\n2278\\n01:43:19,898 --> 01:43:21,780\\nWe'll go 23 insight.\\n\\n2279\\n01:43:26,130 --> 01:43:29,443\\n- Kingston, you're\\r\\nlooking at this chest old\\n\\n2280\\n01:43:31,360 --> 01:43:32,193\\nand full stories.\\n\\n2281\\n01:43:32,193 --> 01:43:36,403\\nAnd now you see it's\\r\\ncovered in skyscrapers.\\n\\n2282\\n01:43:37,380 --> 01:43:39,440\\nAnd it's covered in skyscrapers,\\n\\n2283\\n01:43:39,440 --> 01:43:41,283\\nall this wild stuff all over it.\\n\\n2284\\n01:43:43,660 --> 01:43:46,763\\nThat chest feels good to you.\\n\\n2285\\n01:43:47,948 --> 01:43:51,020\\nYou are well-versed in medicine.\\n\\n2286\\n01:43:51,020 --> 01:43:55,600\\nAnd what you see is a city that is sick\\n\\n2287\\n01:43:55,600 --> 01:44:00,600\\nand you are looking at a shining vaccine.\\n\\n2288\\n01:44:00,930 --> 01:44:01,800\\nYou are looking at this.\\n\\n2289\\n01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:06,380\\nAnd when Lowell says\\n\\n2290\\n01:44:06,380 --> 01:44:10,680\\nlegend, myth, history, and time,\\n\\n2291\\n01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:14,970\\nyou have this sort of vision of...\\n\\n2292\\n01:44:14,970 --> 01:44:17,280\\nYou've never associated yourself\\n\\n2293\\n01:44:17,280 --> 01:44:22,280\\nand Pete with moments in\\r\\ntime before necessarily.\\n\\n2294\\n01:44:23,230 --> 01:44:25,470\\nLike Pete's dream,\\r\\nyou're the waking world.\\n\\n2295\\n01:44:25,470 --> 01:44:28,970\\nYou're real, your community\\r\\nthriving, heart, Pete is wild,\\n\\n2296\\n01:44:28,970 --> 01:44:33,920\\nfantasy, chaos, but also\\r\\nyou kind of realize that\\n\\n2297\\n01:44:33,920 --> 01:44:38,390\\nthere is an association with\\r\\ntime itself with both of you.\\n\\n2298\\n01:44:38,390 --> 01:44:40,680\\nYou are a man of the present.\\n\\n2299\\n01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:43,730\\nThere are people that are alive right now\\n\\n2300\\n01:44:43,730 --> 01:44:46,060\\nand they have needs that need to be met.\\n\\n2301\\n01:44:46,060 --> 01:44:47,630\\nAnd we have to stand up for them\\n\\n2302\\n01:44:47,630 --> 01:44:49,550\\nbecause they are living in this moment.\\n\\n2303\\n01:44:49,550 --> 01:44:52,020\\nThe communities whose blood flows\\n\\n2304\\n01:44:52,020 --> 01:44:54,770\\nin time to the rhythm of the\\r\\ncity is what you stand for.\\n\\n2305\\n01:44:54,770 --> 01:44:59,770\\nAnd Pete being next to Nod is\\r\\nalmost mythically associated\\n\\n2306\\n01:45:00,470 --> 01:45:03,490\\nwith the future, with\\r\\npotential, with chimeric things\\n\\n2307\\n01:45:03,490 --> 01:45:06,163\\nthings that could be anything, right?\\n\\n2308\\n01:45:08,330 --> 01:45:09,820\\nAnd you look at this box\\n\\n2309\\n01:45:09,820 --> 01:45:12,890\\nand suddenly feel a third kind of magic.\\n\\n2310\\n01:45:12,890 --> 01:45:15,090\\nAnd I've already used a\\r\\nmetaphor to compare this thing\\n\\n2311\\n01:45:15,090 --> 01:45:17,150\\nto a vaccine, but there's\\r\\nalmost a comparison\\n\\n2312\\n01:45:17,150 --> 01:45:20,450\\nto a vitamin as well, but\\r\\nthere is some attachment\\n\\n2313\\n01:45:20,450 --> 01:45:25,450\\nof this thing to the past\\r\\nand it is something healthy.\\n\\n2314\\n01:45:30,770 --> 01:45:35,727\\n- Yeah, I think kind of taking that in,\\n\\n2315\\n01:45:35,727 --> 01:45:38,543\\nI look up to Lowell and Iga.\\n\\n2316\\n01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:45,100\\nAnd so Iga you were\\r\\ndescribing the inside is kind\\n\\n2317\\n01:45:45,580 --> 01:45:48,270\\nof being a fairy tale, right?\\n\\n2318\\n01:45:48,270 --> 01:45:53,047\\nLike some kind of castle from\\r\\nthe places that you came.\\n\\n2319\\n01:45:55,730 --> 01:46:00,710\\n- Yes. It's sort of an ideal\\n\\n2320\\n01:46:01,610 --> 01:46:06,610\\nof a castle of the black forest.\\n\\n2321\\n01:46:08,580 --> 01:46:09,960\\n- Is there a possibility, I mean\\n\\n2322\\n01:46:09,960 --> 01:46:12,980\\nwith everything that Lowell\\r\\nis saying about the nature\\n\\n2323\\n01:46:12,980 --> 01:46:17,560\\nof time and what this speaking to kind of\\n\\n2324\\n01:46:17,560 --> 01:46:19,130\\nit is being a positive reaction.\\n\\n2325\\n01:46:19,130 --> 01:46:20,210\\nI mean, is there a chance\\n\\n2326\\n01:46:20,210 --> 01:46:24,090\\nthat what the inside of\\r\\nthat box could be changing?\\n\\n2327\\n01:46:24,090 --> 01:46:28,160\\nIf that box in some way is tied to time\\n\\n2328\\n01:46:28,160 --> 01:46:30,220\\nor represents the past, is\\r\\nthere a way that the inside\\n\\n2329\\n01:46:30,220 --> 01:46:33,230\\nof that box could change to be reflective\\n\\n2330\\n01:46:33,230 --> 01:46:34,720\\nof your present right now\\n\\n2331\\n01:46:34,720 --> 01:46:37,180\\nthat that inside would become the city\\n\\n2332\\n01:46:37,180 --> 01:46:39,343\\nas that becomes the past?\\n\\n2333\\n01:46:40,230 --> 01:46:42,060\\nI mean, is that possibly the change\\n\\n2334\\n01:46:42,060 --> 01:46:44,190\\nthat is happening in your box?\\n\\n2335\\n01:46:44,190 --> 01:46:45,420\\n- I mean, I don't know.\\n\\n2336\\n01:46:45,420 --> 01:46:47,110\\nIt's never happened before.\\n\\n2337\\n01:46:47,110 --> 01:46:51,506\\nI mean, look I'm the first one,\\n\\n2338\\n01:46:51,506 --> 01:46:53,260\\nI'm living here.\\n\\n2339\\n01:46:53,260 --> 01:46:56,313\\nMy daughter's growing up\\r\\nhere, she's born here.\\n\\n2340\\n01:46:57,780 --> 01:47:01,843\\nBut there was no precedent for this.\\n\\n2341\\n01:47:03,400 --> 01:47:05,055\\nThere's no history for this.\\n\\n2342\\n01:47:05,055 --> 01:47:06,770\\nThis is not the history.\\n\\n2343\\n01:47:06,770 --> 01:47:07,880\\nThis is not the past.\\n\\n2344\\n01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:09,693\\nThis is something new.\\n\\n2345\\n01:47:12,790 --> 01:47:16,480\\n- I think your box is incredibly important\\n\\n2346\\n01:47:16,480 --> 01:47:19,743\\nto this moment to whatever is happening.\\n\\n2347\\n01:47:23,156 --> 01:47:28,156\\n- I think Iga is in a very\\r\\nuncomfortable position right now.\\n\\n2348\\n01:47:29,980 --> 01:47:31,610\\nHer family heirloom was\\n\\n2349\\n01:47:31,610 --> 01:47:33,990\\nin this big room full of all\\r\\nthese fucking magical people.\\n\\n2350\\n01:47:33,990 --> 01:47:36,233\\nHow is Iga feeling at\\r\\nthis moment right now?\\n\\n2351\\n01:47:38,260 --> 01:47:41,090\\n- I'm very protective of the box\\n\\n2352\\n01:47:41,090 --> 01:47:45,830\\nbecause that's sort of all that\\r\\nshe's been brought up to do.\\n\\n2353\\n01:47:45,830 --> 01:47:49,480\\nLike day one, protect the box,\\n\\n2354\\n01:47:49,480 --> 01:47:51,983\\nthat's more important\\r\\nalmost than your life.\\n\\n2355\\n01:47:52,970 --> 01:47:57,970\\nBut also she does love the city\\r\\nand she loves her life here.\\n\\n2356\\n01:47:59,220 --> 01:48:02,433\\nAnd she loves that her\\r\\nchildren love their lives here.\\n\\n2357\\n01:48:04,620 --> 01:48:05,700\\nAnd\\n\\n2358\\n01:48:10,090 --> 01:48:14,500\\nshe just feels,\\n\\n2359\\n01:48:14,500 --> 01:48:19,500\\nI think afraid, really afraid to step out.\\n\\n2360\\n01:48:19,585 --> 01:48:22,610\\nShe spent so much of her\\r\\nchildhood being warned\\n\\n2361\\n01:48:22,610 --> 01:48:26,290\\nthat stepping into the\\r\\nspotlight was dangerous.\\n\\n2362\\n01:48:26,290 --> 01:48:30,830\\nAnd the whole reason\\r\\nthat her magic looks fake\\n\\n2363\\n01:48:30,830 --> 01:48:33,883\\nis to make people think\\r\\nthat her magic is fake.\\n\\n2364\\n01:48:35,470 --> 01:48:37,623\\nSo that she can hide in plain sight.\\n\\n2365\\n01:48:38,870 --> 01:48:41,660\\nShe spent her life hiding from everybody\\n\\n2366\\n01:48:41,660 --> 01:48:43,530\\nbecause the important thing is family\\n\\n2367\\n01:48:43,530 --> 01:48:45,420\\nand keeping the family safe.\\n\\n2368\\n01:48:45,420 --> 01:48:48,193\\nAnd the box is a part of the family.\\n\\n2369\\n01:48:50,630 --> 01:48:53,923\\nSo putting that in danger,\\n\\n2370\\n01:48:55,210 --> 01:49:00,000\\neven if it's a means\\n\\n2371\\n01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:04,483\\nto ultimately save it, is scary to her.\\n\\n2372\\n01:49:08,546 --> 01:49:11,530\\n- Iga wrestles with all of that.\\n\\n2373\\n01:49:11,530 --> 01:49:14,800\\nThere are no clear answers to her here.\\n\\n2374\\n01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:19,610\\nAnd I think that Iga is\\r\\nfalling into a lot of loops.\\n\\n2375\\n01:49:19,610 --> 01:49:23,790\\nA lot of loops of how much her\\r\\nlife is shaped by the actions\\n\\n2376\\n01:49:23,790 --> 01:49:28,300\\nof women who came before\\r\\nher, by the traditions\\n\\n2377\\n01:49:28,300 --> 01:49:31,670\\nof this place and about\\r\\nall the weight of history.\\n\\n2378\\n01:49:31,670 --> 01:49:34,750\\nBut also this weight of not exploring,\\n\\n2379\\n01:49:34,750 --> 01:49:36,120\\nlike all the weight of,\\n\\n2380\\n01:49:36,120 --> 01:49:37,750\\nhere's the thing that's going to control\\n\\n2381\\n01:49:37,750 --> 01:49:40,240\\nthe passing of your\\r\\nlife, don't look into it\\n\\n2382\\n01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:42,700\\nand don't ask any fucking\\r\\nquestions about it.\\n\\n2383\\n01:49:42,700 --> 01:49:47,700\\nAnd Iga is different than all the women\\n\\n2384\\n01:49:50,040 --> 01:49:51,623\\nthat came before her.\\n\\n2385\\n01:49:52,870 --> 01:49:54,243\\nYou moved to New York.\\n\\n2386\\n01:49:55,810 --> 01:49:58,070\\nAnd I think that Iga is wrestling\\n\\n2387\\n01:49:58,070 --> 01:50:02,220\\nwith trying to keep a tradition alive.\\n\\n2388\\n01:50:02,220 --> 01:50:04,750\\nWhen you already did\\r\\nsomething that your mother\\n\\n2389\\n01:50:04,750 --> 01:50:05,700\\nand your mother's mother\\n\\n2390\\n01:50:05,700 --> 01:50:07,943\\nand your mother's\\r\\nmother's mother never did.\\n\\n2391\\n01:50:10,880 --> 01:50:14,390\\nAs we move from that, you\\r\\nsee that Lowell steps away\\n\\n2392\\n01:50:14,390 --> 01:50:16,633\\nfrom the box and returns it to you Iga.\\n\\n2393\\n01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:19,920\\nMisiek, (imitates crawling)\\r\\ncrawls up onto it.\\n\\n2394\\n01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:23,050\\n- I pull down my sleeves to take it.\\n\\n2395\\n01:50:23,050 --> 01:50:26,620\\n- Yes, incredible.\\n\\n2396\\n01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:31,620\\nYou see that Esther\\r\\nsteps forward and says,\\n\\n2397\\n01:50:34,167 --> 01:50:38,200\\n\\\"So we can see that this\\r\\nchest and for the time being\\n\\n2398\\n01:50:39,050 --> 01:50:42,000\\nwhich I want to remind the\\r\\nassembled council is the property\\n\\n2399\\n01:50:42,000 --> 01:50:47,000\\nof Mrs. Iga Lisowski and\\r\\nno degree of importance\\n\\n2400\\n01:50:50,310 --> 01:50:55,310\\naround that chest should cancel\\r\\nthe fact in anyone's mind\\n\\n2401\\n01:50:56,410 --> 01:51:01,410\\nthat we would love to work\\r\\nhand in hand with Mrs. Lisowski\\n\\n2402\\n01:51:02,410 --> 01:51:04,740\\nto understand the chest,\\r\\nto the best of our ability.\\n\\n2403\\n01:51:04,740 --> 01:51:07,580\\nAnd how it may be protected by us,\\n\\n2404\\n01:51:07,580 --> 01:51:12,440\\nas it in turn appears to in\\r\\nsome fashion, be protecting us\\n\\n2405\\n01:51:12,440 --> 01:51:17,007\\nby holding this advancing\\r\\ntide of raw umbra at bay.\\\"\\n\\n2406\\n01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:22,050\\n- I will work with you, but I cannot,\\n\\n2407\\n01:51:22,050 --> 01:51:24,103\\nI'm sorry let you take it.\\n\\n2408\\n01:51:26,887 --> 01:51:28,668\\n- You see Esther--\\n\\n2409\\n01:51:28,668 --> 01:51:30,147\\n- This two days already\\r\\nvery stressful for me.\\n\\n2410\\n01:51:30,147 --> 01:51:32,627\\n- You see Esther nods and says,\\n\\n2411\\n01:51:32,627 --> 01:51:34,470\\n\\\"Of course I understand.\\\"\\n\\n2412\\n01:51:34,470 --> 01:51:37,153\\nTony speaks up for the\\r\\nfirst time and says,\\n\\n2413\\n01:51:38,957 --> 01:51:42,893\\n\\\"Madam Anastasia, as I believe\\r\\nyour Appalachian goes here\\n\\n2414\\n01:51:42,893 --> 01:51:47,893\\nin the \\\"Unsleeping City\\\", would you...\\n\\n2415\\n01:51:50,260 --> 01:51:52,570\\nObviously the chest needs\\r\\nto remain in your custody\\n\\n2416\\n01:51:52,570 --> 01:51:54,300\\nyou're the one who understands it the most\\n\\n2417\\n01:51:54,300 --> 01:51:55,880\\nand it's most connected to it.\\n\\n2418\\n01:51:55,880 --> 01:52:00,880\\nWould you find it acceptable\\r\\nto have more protection\\n\\n2419\\n01:52:02,660 --> 01:52:04,120\\nin your life, either to move\\n\\n2420\\n01:52:04,120 --> 01:52:06,940\\nto a more secure location\\r\\nthan your current home\\n\\n2421\\n01:52:06,940 --> 01:52:09,060\\nor to have people posted at your home,\\n\\n2422\\n01:52:09,060 --> 01:52:12,170\\nshould anyone physically\\r\\ncome for the chest?\\\"\\n\\n2423\\n01:52:12,170 --> 01:52:15,710\\n- What'd you think I\\r\\ncan't take care of myself?\\n\\n2424\\n01:52:15,710 --> 01:52:17,946\\nI've been taking care\\r\\nof myself all my life.\\n\\n2425\\n01:52:17,946 --> 01:52:20,738\\n- I know you can take care\\r\\nof yourself Madam Anastasia .\\n\\n2426\\n01:52:20,738 --> 01:52:22,773\\nI'm worried about taking\\r\\ncare of the chest.\\n\\n2427\\n01:52:23,810 --> 01:52:26,120\\n- The chest will take care of itself.\\n\\n2428\\n01:52:26,120 --> 01:52:29,650\\nThe chest has taken care of\\r\\nitself and will continue to\\n\\n2429\\n01:52:29,650 --> 01:52:32,003\\nand nobody else can use the chest but me.\\n\\n2430\\n01:52:35,580 --> 01:52:40,223\\n- You see Esther looks over\\r\\nto Sofia and Pete and says,\\n\\n2431\\n01:52:42,387 --> 01:52:47,387\\n\\\"In addition to dealing with the chest,\\n\\n2432\\n01:52:48,430 --> 01:52:51,430\\nwe seem to have some resolution\\n\\n2433\\n01:52:51,430 --> 01:52:54,060\\nto the infernal business\\r\\nof the \\\"Unsleeping City\\\"\\n\\n2434\\n01:52:54,060 --> 01:52:59,060\\nwith the Night Angel's,\\r\\nvictory over the Jersey devil.\\n\\n2435\\n01:53:00,080 --> 01:53:01,876\\n- Yeah, that's my guy.\\n\\n2436\\n01:53:01,876 --> 01:53:05,108\\n(participants laughing)\\n\\n2437\\n01:53:05,108 --> 01:53:06,358\\n- High five Pete.\\n\\n2438\\n01:53:07,417 --> 01:53:09,993\\n- Esther puts a hand on Ricky's shoulder.\\n\\n2439\\n01:53:11,720 --> 01:53:16,720\\nShe says, \\\"However, I believe\\r\\nthere's some interesting work\\n\\n2440\\n01:53:19,440 --> 01:53:22,427\\nin terms of the dream realm\\r\\nthat we should dive into.\\\"\\n\\n2441\\n01:53:23,910 --> 01:53:27,880\\nAs first fist of the order.\\n\\n2442\\n01:53:27,880 --> 01:53:30,820\\nSofia, would you like to talk about some\\n\\n2443\\n01:53:30,820 --> 01:53:34,836\\nof what you've discovered in\\r\\nthe scrolls of the monastery?\\n\\n2444\\n01:53:34,836 --> 01:53:39,120\\n- Absolutely, I basically, in looking\\n\\n2445\\n01:53:39,120 --> 01:53:43,520\\nthrough the scrolls\\r\\ndiscovered many illusions\\n\\n2446\\n01:53:43,520 --> 01:53:48,520\\nto dream monsters and dream\\r\\nmagic that seemed to exist\\n\\n2447\\n01:53:50,790 --> 01:53:52,863\\nin a deeper part of the dreaming world.\\n\\n2448\\n01:53:54,090 --> 01:53:56,660\\nAnd that was alarming to me.\\n\\n2449\\n01:53:56,660 --> 01:54:00,200\\nAnd I also came across the fact\\n\\n2450\\n01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:05,200\\nthat there was one section in which it\\n\\n2451\\n01:54:05,490 --> 01:54:09,997\\nspeaks how to deal with a monarch of Nod.\\n\\n2452\\n01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:15,870\\nAnd it references the great\\r\\norphan, but it does only say A.\\n\\n2453\\n01:54:17,090 --> 01:54:21,370\\nSo that is alarming to\\r\\nsay the least to suggest\\n\\n2454\\n01:54:21,370 --> 01:54:25,643\\nthat there may be other\\r\\nmonarchies in the dreaming world.\\n\\n2455\\n01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:30,460\\n- And Nadia actually approaches\\r\\nat your mentioning of this\\n\\n2456\\n01:54:30,460 --> 01:54:34,610\\nand spreads that scroll forms\\r\\nof the greater dreaming.\\n\\n2457\\n01:54:34,610 --> 01:54:38,830\\nSo this ancient, enormous\\r\\nscroll of the concrete fist\\n\\n2458\\n01:54:38,830 --> 01:54:39,850\\nis expanded.\\n\\n2459\\n01:54:39,850 --> 01:54:44,420\\nAnd you see, Pete, there\\r\\nis a drawing of Nod\\n\\n2460\\n01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:48,470\\nthe gray orphan, and it's\\r\\nkind of an anatomical drawing.\\n\\n2461\\n01:54:48,470 --> 01:54:53,470\\nAnd you see, there are like\\r\\npressure points on this drawing\\n\\n2462\\n01:54:54,090 --> 01:54:57,410\\nof Nod as like, if you were\\r\\ngoing to fight this thing,\\n\\n2463\\n01:54:57,410 --> 01:54:59,740\\nhere's how you'd fight it.\\n\\n2464\\n01:54:59,740 --> 01:55:01,050\\n- Again, I've prepped everyone\\n\\n2465\\n01:55:01,050 --> 01:55:03,251\\nthat the monastery had\\r\\na different relationship\\n\\n2466\\n01:55:03,251 --> 01:55:05,733\\nwith the dream world than the current one.\\n\\n2467\\n01:55:12,452 --> 01:55:13,460\\n- I mean,\\r\\n- This isn't all of that.\\n\\n2468\\n01:55:13,460 --> 01:55:16,870\\n- I look at Sofia, like\\r\\nobviously we're good.\\n\\n2469\\n01:55:16,870 --> 01:55:17,943\\nI know, I know.\\n\\n2470\\n01:55:17,943 --> 01:55:20,680\\n- This is an artifact from the 1800s,\\n\\n2471\\n01:55:20,680 --> 01:55:22,110\\nI was equally alarmed by it.\\n\\n2472\\n01:55:22,110 --> 01:55:25,062\\nI was surprised. Yeah.\\n\\n2473\\n01:55:25,062 --> 01:55:29,863\\n- You see Tony speaks up and\\r\\nsays, \\\"I'm sorry to interrupt.\\n\\n2474\\n01:55:29,863 --> 01:55:31,267\\nWhat are we alarmed by?\\\"\\n\\n2475\\n01:55:34,150 --> 01:55:38,190\\n- I think that when I\\r\\nsee a lot of this stuff,\\n\\n2476\\n01:55:38,190 --> 01:55:41,820\\nlook there are creatures\\r\\nof the deep dreams that are\\n\\n2477\\n01:55:41,820 --> 01:55:46,783\\ndescribed that sound\\r\\nabsolutely horrifying.\\n\\n2478\\n01:55:48,340 --> 01:55:52,330\\nHowever, I have had very\\r\\npositive interactions\\n\\n2479\\n01:55:52,330 --> 01:55:56,770\\nwith the great orphan and\\r\\nNod and the world of dreams.\\n\\n2480\\n01:55:56,770 --> 01:56:01,770\\nAnd so when I see an anatomical model\\n\\n2481\\n01:56:01,810 --> 01:56:06,050\\nof pressure points to hurt or paralyze\\n\\n2482\\n01:56:06,050 --> 01:56:10,900\\nor stun someone that I\\r\\nconsider a business associate\\n\\n2483\\n01:56:10,900 --> 01:56:15,410\\nat least, that is unusual.\\n\\n2484\\n01:56:16,992 --> 01:56:19,780\\nAnd it disappoints me to\\r\\nthink that there was a time\\n\\n2485\\n01:56:19,780 --> 01:56:24,780\\nthat the grey orphan\\r\\nwould be seen as a foe.\\n\\n2486\\n01:56:31,050 --> 01:56:33,030\\n- You see--\\n\\n2487\\n01:56:33,030 --> 01:56:36,143\\n- Can I look and see like\\r\\nwhat Cindy thinks of that?\\n\\n2488\\n01:56:38,030 --> 01:56:41,693\\n- Yeah, go ahead and\\r\\ngive me an insight check.\\n\\n2489\\n01:56:43,700 --> 01:56:44,533\\n- 13.\\n\\n2490\\n01:56:45,730 --> 01:56:47,850\\nJust like really trying\\r\\nnot to insult Cindy.\\n\\n2491\\n01:56:47,850 --> 01:56:50,410\\n- Cindy is sort of wide-eyed\\n\\n2492\\n01:56:50,410 --> 01:56:52,900\\nand you see she's in the past right now.\\n\\n2493\\n01:56:52,900 --> 01:56:56,020\\nShe remembers the time when\\r\\nthe order felt differently.\\n\\n2494\\n01:56:56,020 --> 01:56:59,070\\nShe was a part of the order\\r\\nwhen the order felt differently.\\n\\n2495\\n01:56:59,070 --> 01:57:03,600\\nAnd I think you recognize in this moment\\n\\n2496\\n01:57:03,600 --> 01:57:06,793\\nit is because of Sofia's victory.\\n\\n2497\\n01:57:08,160 --> 01:57:12,940\\nSofia has everything lined\\r\\nup to be taken seriously\\n\\n2498\\n01:57:12,940 --> 01:57:17,830\\nlike victorious over the American dream,\\n\\n2499\\n01:57:17,830 --> 01:57:21,030\\nsealed a Paragon from destroying New York,\\n\\n2500\\n01:57:21,030 --> 01:57:22,730\\nwas part of this group of people\\n\\n2501\\n01:57:22,730 --> 01:57:25,443\\nthat three years ago saved\\r\\neverybody and everything.\\n\\n2502\\n01:57:30,523 --> 01:57:32,570\\nAnd is the chosen one\\n\\n2503\\n01:57:32,570

Building.\\n\\n2505\\n01:57:39,880 --> 01:57:41,050\\nYou were chosen.\\n\\n2506\\n01:57:41,050 --> 01:57:42,530\\nAnd I think Sofia realizes\\n\\n2507\\n01:57:42,530 --> 01:57:45,360\\nthat you wield an incredible amount\\n\\n2508\\n01:57:45,360 --> 01:57:50,360\\nof status and have pushed\\r\\nthis place very far,\\n\\n2509\\n01:57:51,350 --> 01:57:53,020\\nvery quickly.\\n\\n2510\\n01:57:53,020 --> 01:57:57,390\\nAnd maybe people listened to you\\n\\n2511\\n01:57:57,390 --> 01:58:00,890\\nbecause of how much respect you command\\n\\n2512\\n01:58:00,890 --> 01:58:05,310\\nbut maybe it was a bigger\\r\\ndeal than you thought.\\n\\n2513\\n01:58:05,310 --> 01:58:10,110\\nAnd they did it because\\r\\nyou are so incredible.\\n\\n2514\\n01:58:10,110 --> 01:58:12,960\\nBut the other side\\n\\n2515\\n01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:15,790\\nof that coin to borrow\\r\\nCody's expression is\\n\\n2516\\n01:58:15,790 --> 01:58:20,600\\nthat they did it because they\\r\\nrespect and believe in you\\n\\n2517\\n01:58:20,600 --> 01:58:23,393\\nbut they didn't get here themselves.\\n\\n2518\\n01:58:25,710 --> 01:58:29,240\\n- Okay, yeah, I'm just\\r\\ntrying to be really sweet\\n\\n2519\\n01:58:30,324 --> 01:58:35,324\\nand make this a gentle\\n\\n2520\\n01:58:39,300 --> 01:58:43,170\\ninsinuation for the older\\r\\nmembers in the room.\\n\\n2521\\n01:58:43,170 --> 01:58:44,003\\n- Cool.\\n\\n2522\\n01:58:46,870 --> 01:58:49,920\\n- I definitely shoot\\r\\nPete a little, I'm sorry.\\n\\n2523\\n01:58:49,920 --> 01:58:53,273\\nPlease know that I wish I\\r\\ncould speak more frankly.\\n\\n2524\\n01:58:55,440 --> 01:59:00,440\\n- So you see Esther cast a\\r\\nmessage cantrip to you Pete\\n\\n2525\\n01:59:02,110 --> 01:59:05,653\\nand actually asks while\\r\\nSofia is talking and says,\\n\\n2526\\n01:59:07,117 --> 01:59:08,470\\n\\\"Do you want to share what you shared\\n\\n2527\\n01:59:08,470 --> 01:59:09,570\\nwith us on the ferry

not.\\n\\n2531\\n01:59:16,730 --> 01:59:17,563\\n- Cool.\\n\\n2532\\n01:59:25,140 --> 01:59:28,210\\nSo the meaning is sort of talking\\n\\n2533\\n01:59:28,210 --> 01:59:29,950\\nabout these deeper threats.\\n\\n2534\\n01:59:29,950 --> 01:59:31,777\\nAnd so Esther says,\\n\\n2535\\n01:59:31,777 --> 01:59:35,620\\n\\\"So it seems likely given\\r\\neverything that Sofia has said\\n\\n2536\\n01:59:35,620 --> 01:59:39,330\\nand our experience with the raw\\r\\numbra leaking into the city,\\n\\n2537\\n01:59:39,330 --> 01:59:41,560\\nthe appearance of these\\r\\ninfernals,

--> 02:00:08,620\\nbut it's full of life because\\r\\nit is close to dreamers.\\n\\n2545\\n02:00:08,620 --> 02:00:09,770\\nIt is symbiotic.\\n\\n2546\\n02:00:09,770 --> 02:00:12,340\\nIt exists in

--> 02:00:42,640\\nexplain the runaway A train\\n\\n2554\\n02:00:42,640 --> 02:00:44,240\\non Halloween.\\n\\n2555\\n02:00:44,240 --> 02:00:46,870\\nIt may even explain the

02:00:56,880\\nHowever, what seems clear is that\\n\\n2559\\n02:00:58,000 --> 02:00:59,310\\nthese effects are happening\\n\\n2560\\n02:00:59,310 --> 02:01:02,000\\nbecause of events happening\\r\\non the other side.\\n\\n2561\\n02:01:02,000 --> 02:01:02,880\\nAnd so it is possible\\n\\n2562\\n02:01:02,880 --> 02:01:06,350\\nthat an expedition should\\r\\npotentially be planned\\n\\n2563\\n02:01:06,350 --> 02:01:09,430\\nor some deeper understanding at least\\n\\n2564\\n02:01:09,430 --> 02:01:12,163\\nof what is going on should occur.\\n\\n2565\\n02:01:13,760 --> 02:01:15,380\\nAnd it is also clear\\n\\n2566\\n02:01:15,380 --> 02:01:17,310\\nthat the time has come where the resources\\n\\n2567\\n02:01:17,310 --> 02:01:19,950\\nof the city should be

I\\'ll be sure to come pick you up.  Here we go again.I\\'ll come pick him up.  No number...  They have no intention of doing that.  Hey hurry up and delete the video.  Your eyes are bright too huh?  Just not much hair on the eyebrows.  Even so you\\'re such a cute kid.  How could they think ofgetting rid of you? Really huh?  So you\\'re Woosung.  That\\'s right Woosung.  You can be happy with us now. OK?  Right?  iFor those wanting to transferto a bus or an express bus  iplease exit now.  iThe exit for the BusanWest Intercity Bus Terminal  iis exit .  iGimhae International Airport is...   How\\'s your knee? Huh?   Your knees hurt right? Yes I\\'m okay.   You okay? Oh it\\'s gotten a lot better.  Okay.  You should come more often.  It\\'ll be good for youto exercise.  It\\'s been a while so I just wantto rest whenever I come here.  Is the laundry doing well these days?  It\\'s soso...  iHey Socrates...  By the way  I can\\'t believethey\\'re thinking of  using baby boxesfor human trafficking.  That\\'s really bold.  It\\'s their fault for makingthose boxes in the first place  it\\'s creating irresponsible mothers...  You have a nice side to you.  Why?  Oh that baby.  He would\\'ve diedif he had been left on that floor.  I am nice.  You didn\\'t know?  Was it a boy or a girl?   Hello. How have you been?  You worked hard.  That dish last time was really good  It was Shu Shu...   Schweinshaxen. Oh Schweinshaxen.  The day after  I was so surprisedbecause my skin was so smooth.  What are you saying?It\\'s just pig\\'s feet.  And uhdo you happen to know Choucroute?  I\\'m gonna try making that next.  You should come to have a bite.  It\\'s just boiled pork. It\\'s bland.  I left the white one at the laundry.  I brought it in black instead.   It\\'s thick. Oh thanks.   And this too just in case... Right thanks.   Go okay go. Okay.   Take care. Yeah okay.  Whatever the situation is  you should get out of the carand say goodbye...  It\\'s fine.  He stays home all day anyways.  It\\'s good for himto get some exercise.  He\\'s a perfect matchfor a marriage partner.  Oh really?  What about it? Do you want him?  Because even if you have a kid  he can look after the kidsince he writes from home...  The baby\\'s mother came to see him?  Is something wrong?  Yes.  They left the babyoutside. Outside the box.  Could it have been a mistake?Because she was flustered?  Hey if you think they\\'re gonna go tothe police just bring the baby here OK?  I\\'ll do that.  Okay.  There\\'s nothing on the records...  Call the pastor.  And can you please give Sookyunga bath for me?  OK sure.  You were on nightwatch yesterday right?  Yes every Sunday...  Can you show hersome of the babies you have now?  This is a playroom for big kids.  There are  kids living here.  They\\'re all abandoned in the baby box.  He came in last week...  The mother was  years old...  His mom is from Pakistan.  She said she was a babysitter.  That\\'s it?  Yes for now.  What about letters?Did you put a letter with the baby?  Yes.  How about your name and contact number?Did you write that too?  So even if you have a baby  there\\'s no evidencethat you\\'re the mother...  What\\'s going on?  She\\'s looking for a baby named Woosung.  She says she left a babyoutside the baby box yesterday.  If you had put the baby in the boxour staff would have gone out  right away and spoken to you.  Yes.   That\\'s what I said. Peekaboo.  Peekaboo  Of course not.  Kidnapping?  What are you talking about?  Hey don\\'t you think so?  You threw him away.  What are you talking about?I just left him with you for a bit.  Do you think we\\'re like a dog hotel?  I even wrote in the letterthat I\\'d come and pick him up.  If there\\'s a message saying  you\\'re coming back for the baby  the church takesthe baby off the adoption list.  He\\'s % going to a childcare facility.  Do you know what that means?  Well I\\'m sure you did it out of love  but that\\'s what narrows downthis kid\\'s future possibilities.  We...  uh Woosung...  we want to save Woosungfrom that dark future.  It\\'s better for himto grow up in a nice home  than to be an orphanin a childcare facility...  It\\'s much better.  Adoption.  We\\'re looking for parents to raise him.  You don\\'t have the right to do that.  You don\\'t have the right eitheryou abandoned him.   You stole him. To protect.  Yes of course.We don\\'t have the right. We don\\'t.  In other words...  Should I say it\\'s with good intentions?  Good intentions...  I haven\\'t heard those words in a while.  There are people wanting childrenbut can\\'t have them  and can\\'t waitfor the screening period  we can send the baby to those parents.  You\\'re in an explainable situation.  Your name is...  It\\'s Seonah Moon Seonah.  Miss Seonah.  You can think of us as a cupid  that sends your precious babyto those parents.  I promise to findthe best adoptive parents for Woosung.  Cupid my ass.  Yeah wellit\\'s a bit strange to call us that...  What\\'s another good name...  Should we call ourselves the storks?Since it\\'s two of us two storks?  Oh and...  It\\'s case by casebut there\\'s a little reward.  A reward?  How much was it?  It\\'s about  million won for a boy.  For who?  Of coursefor you and us the mediators...  Good intentions my ass.  You\\'re just a broker.  To put it simply yes.  When is the departure?   Get some rest. Yes go home.  Yes.  She\\'s the mother of that baby right?  I\\'m not sure.  She doesn\\'t look like it...  Oh Taeho.  What are doing h...  Oh hello.  We\\'re temporarily closed for today..  I don\\'t know if this can be removed...  Oh this...  This is...  It\\'s obviously blood.  I\\'ll give it a try.  And the  the money could be here by next week...  We\\'re going to opena chicken restaurant here.  Well if you can\\'tI\\'ll take you to the casino.  No. I\\'m not going back.

Why are you nagging me?  Mind your own business old man.  You were doing a goodat the restaurant with your mom.  Those noodlesmake me sick to my stomach now.  What was that?  Nothing.

Ms. Sunah let\\'s go let\\'s go.  It\\'s like she\\'s crazy for money.   ? That\\'s right.  At least divide it into three...  If we take the GyeongbuExpressway to Yeongdeok  it will take us hours and  minutes.  We\\'ll take a break at the rest stopin Gyeongju around lunch time.  They wouldn\\'t go too farwith a car like that right?  Maybe Ulsan or Pohang?  I wanna take a showerand change as soon as possible.  You know right?  We\\'re gonna catch them redhanded.  Ms. Sunah where are you from?  I\\'m from Busan.  He\\'s selfproclaimed from Seoul.  Selfproclaimed?  Where are you from then?  Yeosu.  Yeosu?  There\\'s nothingbut gondolas there isn\\'t it?

No no   That\\'s not a goal That\\'s not a goal Yoonwoo.  Yeah?  Let Hajun borrow it now.  Haejin that\\'s enough football.  Five more minutes please  He\\'s not improving much that kid.  I see that the scar is still there.  You bled so much when that happened.  I called the ambulance and everythingIt was crazy.  There was a kite on the branch  I was going to grab itwhen it broke...  Youngmin is the onlytroublemaker like that now.  Youngmin?  Oh Youngmin?  He\\'s escaping now.  Again?  At least that hasn\\'t changed.  I haven\\'t heard from him.  Sorry to say...  That\\'s not why I visit anymore.  Well at firstit\\'s like a blind date.  Toe.  Okay I\\'ll take a pictureand send it to you. Okay.  His eyebrows are a bit thin huh?  Excuse me for a second.   That\\'s weird. Huh?  What? He looks strong with this.  But why am I playing the wife?   Everyone here knows Dongsoo. Oh it\\'s a baby.  Then you can tellthem I\\'m your daughter.  iSo cute.  We don\\'t look alike at all.  Hey kid don\\'t touch him.  Your hands are dirty from the ball.  I said don\\'t touch him.  And we\\'re doing thisuntil someone comes to buy him.  What\\'s the big deal?Hey don\\'t touch him  your hands are dirty from the ball.  He has weird eyebrows.  Can I be your son?  Why?  I want to play football.  Football?  I want to make a lotof money like Son Heungmin.  Well it hasn\\'t been longsince Woosung was born...  And it\\'s too early to talkabout a second kid right?  Right one\\'s enough.  It would be a good suggestion.  There was a kid from herewho became a professional footballer.  He wore... what was it  the team with stripes on their uniforms?  No idea.  Well these facilitiesthey promote saying  even people like us can succeed but  %  Stop being a smart ass.  % is great too.  Look at him getting riled upabout this place.  What percentof the average is successful then...  Who is it?  They said he escaped.Must\\'ve been caught and brought back.  I broke Dongsoo\\'s record  It took them  days to catch me.  That\\'s nothing to brag about.  Considering time and distanceI was much ahead.  You must be real proud.  Yes hello?  iOkay I understand.You\\'re in Uljin right?   No no. That\\'s alright. What the hell?   We\\'ll see you tomorrow. What\\'s up with your eyebrows?  Here is your order seafood doenjang.  The coin laundromat...  This is Siwoo hewas a grade below me.   I was the forward. Buttons.   And he was the midfielder. Do they attach the buttons?  Back then we would\\'ve madetwo football teams.   Don\\'t you think so? Well now   When I go as a coach... I take the seams out  from pants they shortened    players... The worn out knees.   They don\\'t put a lining right? No there\\'s no one.  You know that law adoption...  Yeah the adoption law.  The conditions foroverseas adoptions  became more strictso I thought it was good.  But don\\'t all the kidswant to be adopted?  Oh well...  That kid that likes footballhe seems very active.  Yes Haejin.  It\\'s already too late for him.  He\\'s  years old.  He\\'s .  Oh too late. Too late.  Too late for him.  Adoption... you can saythat\\'s only for kids  below ...  Even he should know by now...  There are also kids that comebecause they don\\'t want it.  There was a case likethat recently remember?  The adopted child was abused.  It\\'s because bloodis thicker than water.  Think about what would\\'ve happened  if the parents had a biological babyafter the adoption.  Yeah that\\'s for most of the kids hereat least once right?  They were denied of their existencewhen they were abandoned right?  And they experience it again.  Then I\\'ve been denied all my life.  What?  Then do something about that whistle.  You\\'re not the military.  Hey  The whistle.  For me it\\'s like  me wanting to be like a father to them.  Understand?  So that\\'s why I\\'m using this whistlelike this OK?  Hey hurry up and hide.  Good night my baby.  In the front garden and back garden  birds and baby sheep  they\\'re all asleep.  She was singing.  What song?  A lullaby.  A lullaby?  It\\'s so nice here becausethey have everything you need.  Let\\'s take it all.  Rub his earlobes like this.  You talk too much...  Well if we search a little more  we could find a someonewith better conditions.  Just go with the ones in Uljin.  All done.  You were so good during your bath.  Your mom wants to say goodbye to youas soon as possible.  We\\'re working so hard...  Do you know how hardit is to raise a child by yourself?  That\\'s still not a reason to  abandon your child.  How are you goingto justify selling them?  There are peopleselling them because  there are peopleabandoning them.  That\\'s the right order.  Then you shouldn\\'t have made that box.  That\\'s what I\\'m saying.  It\\'s only there to make the mothersfeel at ease  by telling them we\\'re savingthe baby or whatever.  That\\'s not the case.Woosung is alive  because of that box.  That wipe has alcohol in ityou can\\'t wipe his face with that.  Look at him crying.  Sorry I\\'m sorry.  Then how many mothersdo you think come back for them  after leaving only a letter behind?  How would I know?  It\\'s one out of forty.  You never hear fromthe other  ever again.  Why are you only complaining about themothers? Say the same about the dads.  You could\\'ve at least leftyour contacts in the letter.  This is the second time hearing that.  What? You want me to tell you again?  I can tell you many times as you want.  Who are you to be so arrogant?  Do you think you\\'resomething because  the kids call you big brother  at this pathetic place?  You feel proud?Then just stay here.  Oh it\\'s cold.  He thought  his mother would be one in forty.  Well you see that old door there  outside at the playground? Over there.  They said he was abandoned there  with a letter saying\"I\\'ll be back to get you.\"  That\\'s the reason why he\\'s so grumpyso please cut him some slack.  Jiyoung was working.  Yeah she came back.  Becoming a singer wasnever gonna happen.  I liked her voice though.   to .  Well  we all settle down here.  But it looks fun.   Yeah?  to .  Fun?  It\\'s more fun thanbeing alone I suppose.  Still.  You should go far away far.  Far away where?  Far.  You\\'re the hopeand the star for us kids.  Where am I supposed to go?  Anywhere.  I think it\\'ll be sadif you do come back really.  Good morning.  Woosung it\\'s raining.  It\\'s raining.  This is a raindrop.  It\\'s the same thing.  I\\'m sorry about yesterday.  I was too harsh.  I don\\'t remember.  I have these dreams sometimes  it\\'s raining...  And the rain washes me cleanfrom everything of my past.  But when I open my eyes  it\\'s still pouring.  And nothing has changed.  Wouldn\\'t it be okayif you had an umbrella?  An umbrella?  Yes a big umbrella.  Something that two people can use...  Stop it.  I hope it\\'s redOne with strawberries on it.  When I was youngmy friend had something like that.  I was so jealous.  You stole it?  Yeah I took it and threw it away.  But they\\'re not blood related are they?  Yeah everyone calls her mom but...  Everyone?  It woke me upand my husband too.  We were so shockedthat we couldn\\'t sleep.  What\\'s happening?  No a police car came to them.   What\\'s happened? Huh? Quiet quiet.   Hey come here. Hold on a second.  No that...  I\\'ve never seen him before.What\\'s going on?  He was killed in a hotel then...  Take a good look.  It\\'s a picture captured by the hotelCCTV. The girl lives here right?  Yej.  Take the kids over there.  Really in front of the kids..  Hang on. Hey tall kid.  Tall kid wait a minute.  Here candy.  You can tell me anything.  She lives here right?  I don\\'t know.  Ma\\'am  This kid here is a baby isn\\'t he?  I told her not to give birth.How can a girl become a mother?  What? What did you say?  I said I told her not to give birth  How can a girl likethat become a mother?  Quiet Quiet  Then is this... what you do here.  Is this motherlike?  Well I  just took care of the kidswho didn\\'t have a place to go.  Murder?  You mean prostitution?  So you\\'re saying  that she needed to runbut the baby got in her way.  Give me three days. I\\'m going tomake sure they sell within that time.  If it\\'s murderthe detective department will move?  They\\'re already on the move.  We should set them up.  A setup?  As a buyer.   The person you\\'re calling... Shit...  She\\'s not picking upthe one from Uljin.  This is all because you sent herthe picture with weird eyebrows.  What do you think of this?   million won.  Twice the market price...  Do you want to meet them?  Huh? Who?  I think it\\'s the owner of the building.  How old is the woman?  .   Why? You want someone younger?  No it\\'s not that.  I have a bad feeling about this though.  Isn\\'t this too cheap?   million?  The market price for the baby.  A girl baby only costs  million won.  Miss  Yeah?  Using bait to provoke crime...  Two million won.   Isn\\'t that against the law? What\\'s the difference?  This is pissing me off.  What did you say?  I\\'ve learned that it\\'s not even takenas evidence in a trial.  They had intentionsto commit the crime from the start.  This isn\\'t crime induction.  It\\'s giving them an opportunity.  Opportunity...  iOh Bro Socrates...  Hey if we get a deal there you know...  Do you want to go to that placewhen we get back to Busan?  Are you asking to go see Jennifer?  No you can go on your own.   I\\'m not interested in those places. Keep it down you punk...  You\\'re good attalking nonsense even in this situation.  Just to relax the situation.  Even in the militarybefore the soldiers go to training.  You didn\\'t even go to the militarybecause you were in jail.  You didn\\'t go either.  You exempted forbeing from an orphanage.  I\\'m on the same levelas gold medalists.  Why is love like this again?  What\\'s wrong?  Why would you pull over here?  I think I\\'m gonna pee.  I\\'m really going to pee.  This kid...  I told you.I have a bad feeling about this.  That hunch was this?  Car was shaking so muchthat I almost peed a little bit.  This car stinks.  Look at this kid talking like thisNo one told you to get in the car.  Sir can you take me with you?  No everyone will be worried.  I\\'ll give you some moneyyou take the bus home by yourself.  No.  Why are you trying tointerrupt our family trip?  I already know.You\\'re not a family.  You\\'re trying to sell Woosung.   How much did you hear? Everything.  Please be careful.I\\'ll put this here.  The important thingis to not say negative things like  \"The baby doesn\\'t have thick hair\"or \"His eyes are too small.\"  And don\\'t ask the motherabout the baby\\'s biological father.   There must be something going on. Okay   Have some coffee. Yes thank you.  Yes thank you.  Do they look like building owners?  Aren\\'t you a bit young?  I\\'m sorry.  No you don\\'t need to apologize.  Oh okay.  So you two are married  but not officially registered.  That\\'s why official adoptionis not an option for you.   Okay. Yes.  And let\\'s say yoursperm count is a bit low.  Me?  Just give them the moneyquickly and do it naturally.  Got it. Your sperm countis low and speak naturally...  Not enough sperm countand money quickly...  Then let\\'s practice our line.  Yes okay.  And this is the money we\\'ve prepared.  It\\'s already been  years sincewe started the infertility treatment.  And we\\'re exhausted from waiting.  Hey detective how about we mentionthe de facto marriage story here?  Since our marriage is not legal  legal adoption is not easysomething like that...  Okay let\\'s go with that.  Thank you.  We will cherish himlike our actual child.  Should we take outthe \"actual\" from that sentence?  Should I take out \"actual\"?  Oh okay minus the \"actual\" right.  Let\\'s really cherish our childrenNo...  We will cherish our children...   What did I say? Cherish.  Oh right.

That\\'s enough.   I should pay huh? Yeah this is really happening.  Give them the money...   Even his eyebrows are now... And your infertility treatment?  We\\'ve already beendoing it for  years soâ\\x80¦   Both of us. Both of us have gotten tired of it.   Right. So that\\'s why weâ\\x80¦  We\\'re not officially married so...  Honey.  Have you tested for AMH?  Or HSG?   Yeah well that one... Yes.  I guess Letrozole didn\\'t work.  Yes. Letrozole had suchserious side effects so I...  It\\'s so hard for her to watch me likethat so I intend to stop taking it now.  Letrozole is anovulationinducing product.  Of course it won\\'twork if you take that.  I know right? So my sperm...  We\\'re talking aboutovulationinducing drugs.  Why are you bringing up sperm?  Here here.Take this take this.  That\\'s just for resale right?  I recognized it right away.  Do you know aboutreselling medication?  Haejin don\\'t open that window.   Someone paid them to do it. Don\\'t touch me.  But how do you knowso much about infertility treatment?  Wow there\\'s a lot of foam.  No something similarhappened last year hyung was scammed.  I said don\\'t touch me.I\\'m just just looking.  If we had given up on him  Woosung would have goneto another country by now...  Hey  Hey hey close it close it you punk  Close it you punkHey hey close it. Hurry up  He\\'s going to catch a cold.  Let\\'s take care of what\\'s in the back.  Stop it.  But that driver\\'slicense I saw earlier...  Yeah?  Who\\'s Ha Jinyoung?  Sanghyun is my nicknameFrom when I was in the military.  Right so hyung you know you didn\\'t goto the military don\\'t you? Right?  Figure it out punk.  What about you?  \"I have a weak stomachso I get motion sickness\"?  Wasn\\'t that entirely real?  What do you mean it was real?It was completely ridiculous.  Haejin was better.  Idiot.  Actually the name Sanghyun...  I was going to give it tomy son when he was born.  Really?  Yeah.  It\\'s not really a funnystory or anything huh?  Soyoung...  Huh?  My real name is Moon Soyoung.  Then Sunah is...  Just a really annoyinglady who lives next door.  What a bunch of liars am I right?  I mean since this happened...  Should we use it?  A person\\'s death.  Hello.  Who\\'s this?  Hand over the baby.  You paid all the money to that mother.   million won.  You were supposed to erasethat baby on that condition.  Why did you give birth to that baby?  Moon Soyoung we\\'re the police.  Can I talk with you for a moment?  You\\'re here?  You\\'re here?  Took you a while.  We\\'re making a threeperson workresponsibility schedule.  A work responsibility schedule?  A schedule for feeding milk to Woosung.  Did something good happen?  Yes.  I have a guest in Seoul.  They\\'re giving me  million won.  Oh that\\'s amazing.  Are you going to give him a bath now?  Oh no.  He has poop on his buttand this hyung is really bad at this.  Okay twohour shifts from  p.m.  until  a.m. how about that?  \"Sang Dong So Dong Sang...\"  Wait this is a schedule whereyou sleep well for  hours ya know.  No rather than sleeping wellâ\\x80¦can\\'t I do this?   That\\'s a bit too much. Oh really?   I want to do it. What?   Feeding him powdered milk. Really?   Then from am to am? Yes.  Then from pm to pm.  You can\\'t take yourshift out and give it away.  Don\\'t you think she seemseasy to cooperate with?  You\\'re right.  Did the commutationof the sentence reduction work?  No I don\\'t think so.   iGive it to me. Then what?  iHey then...  I don\\'t know well I...  I don\\'t know but...  iJust do it all.  I don\\'t think it\\'s a commutation.  iI want to take a bath too.  You wash yourself.  Geez I don\\'t want to.  How is he? Did you feed him?  No he threw up again.  Are you sure you cooled it down?Isn\\'t it because it\\'s too hot?  It was fine.  Is it because he got wet yesterday?  I\\'m sorry Woosung.  No it\\'s not your fault.  No I don\\'t think it\\'s just a cold...  Have you ever done it before?  We have to take himto the hospital hyung.  We can\\'t do that.We might get caught.  It\\'s not like meningitis right?  Since yesterdayhis fever suddenly went up...  Will he get better?  What if he dies?  Is he your little brother?  Yes.  He\\'ll be fine. He won\\'t die.  It looks like a cold  but make sure that youkeep an eye on him  so that it doesn\\'tspread into pneumonia.  For now I\\'ll give you a fever reducer.  If his fever doesn\\'t go downcome back tomorrow.  Woosung that\\'s great.  What\\'s sadder than love  is affection.  Will the baby be okay?  Everyone\\'s making a fuss...  Anyway It\\'s just a cold.  Well that\\'s true but...  But it\\'ll be a big problemif he doesn\\'t get better soon.  Are you afraid theywon\\'t be able to sell him?  Well if they can\\'t sell himwe can\\'t catch them in the act.  I thought since you\\'re in the Departmentfor Women and Adolescentsâ\\x80¦  I thought you should\\'vecast your net a little  higher up the riverthan the detectives.  Higher up the river?  Shouldn\\'t you have saved herfirst before she abandoned the baby?  That\\'s the Departmentof Health\\'s job okay?  Before she throws him awayit\\'s Department of Health\\'s case.  After she abandonshim it\\'s the police\\'s.  Seriously.  Team leaderwhy are you so cold to that woman?  She\\'s irresponsible.  Because she gave birthto him and threw him away  but we can\\'t concludethat she\\'s the same.  Do you understand how a motherfeels about abandoning her child?  I guess I can\\'t.  He can\\'t do this.This isn\\'t a playground.  Right yes this is...   Are you his father? Oh yes...   There are a lot of patients hereâ\\x80¦ Okay.   Please be careful. Yes okay.  Are you Woosung\\'s father?  Yeah oh...  Yes.  What\\'s his resident registration number?   Got it? Yes.  Okay.  Actually he\\'s only one month old so...   One month? Everyone was surprised.  Is it because of thatpowdered milk? That...  That American brand... What was it?  Similac...  Similac.   His grandmother is in the countryside. Yes.   I wonder how many she sent me... I know.  She must be so happyto have her first grandchild.  Okay then Woosung\\'sfather please come this way...  Oh okay.  Gosh that kidhe plays soccer all the time...  That\\'s why the owner always squeaks.  Jin jin ja ra Jir jir ja.   Jin jin ja ra Jir jir ja. What\\'s wrong with him and how...  Thank you for taking care of Woosung.  Well babies get fever and they grow up.  If I were aloneI wouldn\\'t be able to do anything.  You don\\'t have to do it all by yourself.  The father  of Woosung?  I was against it from the beginning.  I see...  She probably ran away with the baby.  Find him and bring him back.  The girl?  The baby.  What are you going to do with the baby?  I\\'m going to raise him.  I will.  Because he\\'s my husband\\'s child.  It\\'s fully automatic?Are you kidding me?  How do you do this?  Oh Taeho.  Uh I\\'m sorrybut I\\'ll rush the money.  What?  Baby? Who who?  Woosung\\'s father?  How much?  Four thousand?  He\\'s totally asleep.  I guess he\\'s tired.  You\\'ve been worrying about him all day.  He looks like Siwoo.  These types don\\'tsell well and get left behind.  Didn\\'t you want to be adopted?  I really liked it there.  That\\'s why I refusedto talk about adoption.  Because your mom said she\\'d pick you up?  What else did hyung tell you?  Um he told me about the letter.  \\'Cause I never thought I\\'d be abandoned.  He fell asleep.  Do you want to try?  Please just do me a favor.  Put his chin on your shoulder.  I know. I know.   No a little higher. I said I know.   Hey that\\'s too weak... Oh you\\'re too loud just...  You\\'re not taking careof Woosung on purpose are you?  Huh?  I\\'m afraid you won\\'t beable to part ways later.  Why are you laughing?  It\\'s perfect for girls.  Why are you sayingthe same thing as hyung?  Where are you going?  Convenience store.  Do you want me to go instead?  There are things thatwomen can\\'t ask others to do.  Bring an umbrella in case it rains.  Come and pick me up if it rains.  With an umbrella.  I don\\'t want to.  I\\'ll be back.  Where did you meet that mother?  I was sleeping on Songdo beachafter running away from home  and she told me to come if I was hungry.  And then you wereforced to prostitute yourself?  Do you pity me?   No that\\'s not what I meant... I did it even before I met his mom.  Then why did you kill him?  It\\'s because of well  fit of rage?  In a fit of rage?  He\\'s telling me to lick it before Itake a shower that crazy bastard...  So the first other person... mean was it selfdefense or...  If you want to know the list ofthe other customers I can tell you.  That\\'s enough.All I want to know is...  Is this an interrogation? Or a sermon?  Like I said the babywill be sold so don\\'t worry.  My team leaderand I want to help you...  Have you ever abandoned a child?  Have you ever killed a man?  Okay then tell mebecause I don\\'t understand.  Why did you throw him awayoutside the church?  You saw that?  If you left him like that he\\'d be dead.  That\\'s becauseI didn\\'t want to see him again.  Why did you give birthto him if you couldn\\'t raise him?  Are you saying Ishould\\'ve aborted him?  If you\\'re thinking about the childdon\\'t you have that option?  Is it lighter crimeto kill the child  before giving birththan to throw it away  after giving birth?  Well...  Since no one wants them  aren\\'t babies moreunhappy when they\\'re born?  You\\'re saying I should\\'vekilled him before he was born?  You talk like thatin front of Woosung?  What did you mean by throwing him away?  Yes.  Uh you know  can you get me someclothes? My buttons fell off.  Yes in Uljin.  Right?  No it\\'s okay.  Look at this.Hold on. Listen to this song.  Hello? Oh can you hearit? Do you remember this?  In the movie we watched together...  The one that came out...  That\\'s right.  In reality wellthat\\'s not gonna happen.  Rice? What rice?  Oh like in the wedding?  Yes.  No I don\\'t think so.  Sorry.  It\\'s just.  Poke it on the outside.  Look at the bottomof the button like this.  If you spin it a few timesif you spin it like this  it\\'s not coming off.  Wow Dongsoo hyunghow do you do that?   Haejin try this one too. I want to do it too.  I said try this one out too.  No I want to do this.  What kind of person areyou meeting tomorrow?  Someone rich of course.  With that  million won...  It\\'s .  Oh yeah yeah yeah. It\\'s  .  Why? What kind ofperson do you want it to be?  Someone as pretty as Soyoung.  Hey Dongsoo learn from him. Learn.  You shouldn\\'t leta man say such empty words man.  Oh I learned a lesson Master.  What?  I couldn\\'t hear you that well.  In the past it was said theeldest son takes after  his mom and the eldestdaughter takes after her dad.  So our house is ruined.  It\\'s okay. We don\\'t live together.  That\\'s all superstition.  Oh she\\'s the eldest daughter.  Shut up.  Whenever I see picturesof my mom I get surprised.  I thought it was me.  The button was about to fall off.  Now okay.  Where are you going?  To wash up.  Even he  doesn\\'t know his parents\\' faces either.  Living without knowing...  There are cases like that.  It\\'s better if Woosungdoesn\\'t know my face.  Why do you think so?  Because I\\'m a murderer.  Murder?  Yes.  Who\\'d you kill?  Woosung\\'s biological father.  Why?  He shouldn\\'t have been born like this.  I was going to take Woosung away.  What?  His wife is probably after me by now.  So if you\\'re going to sell it properlyyou can leave me behind.  Uh I\\'m out of the motel right now.  Okay hold on.  Uh wait.  Let me ask you something.  Hyung.  What are you doing here?  Well what So young said yesterdaywas on my mind so I looked here.  This...  What\\'s this?  Is this GPS?Where did you find this?  Over here.  Is it the police?  The police don\\'t useold items like this these days.  That means they\\'ve been following us.  Don\\'t you think so?  Woosung\\'s paternal side.  I can\\'t.  Can\\'t what?  Hyung you\\'re thinkingof leaving Soyoung here.  Well...  This time it\\'s not moneyit\\'s about convincing So young.

Woosung\\'s dad is dead.  Who cares?You just need to get paid.  I mean who the hell istrying to save Woosung?  A dead man\\'s wife.  What is she going todo after buying him?

As long as it\\'s notlike installments or anything like that.   Soyoung. Yes?  You put Woosung in the box.  I mean were youreally going to pick him up again?  No.  I don\\'t know.  But...  If we have met a little earlier...  I wouldn\\'t have had to throw him away.  It\\'s not too late.  Huh? What was that?  Oh nothing.  Soyoung only has you Mr. Sanghyun.You\\'re too mean.  Really? Okay touch the baton then.  What kind of man do you like noon a?  Huh?  I\\'m not sure.  A guy who looks goodin overalls like you?  Haejin that\\'s a nice name.  I like your name.

I was thinking in the future...  I want to raise Woosung as my own child.  So I don\\'t want Woosung  to meet his biologicalmother after this.  I\\'m sure it\\'ll be hard  so think about it slowly today.  No on a noon a over here.Here here here.  Wow that turned out good.   Thank you. Thank you.  It\\'s a monorail. Bye.  Good bye.  Let\\'s take a picture here.Let\\'s take a picture.  Come in hurry.  Do you have money?   won.  What prize do you want?  No not yet not yet.I haven\\'t tried it yet.  Hold on hold on.  The monkey dollthe monkey doll   The monkey doll. I\\'m screwed.  I can\\'t make a mistake huh?  Wa wait.   I want to try it too. Go Go Go  I want to try too.  Haejin there\\'s a soccer fieldLook.   Okay. Yeah?   That\\'s the soccer field. Okay.  I\\'m scared right now.I\\'m afraid of heights.  Oh myBut you said wanted to ride it.  Back then I was just...  Hey what\\'s wrong with your face?  Hey you\\'re not goingto throw up are you?  Why are you so blue?Are you okay?   Hey you can\\'t throw up here. Okay.   Huh? Okay.   Don\\'t throw up here. Okay.  Gosh this kid.

Okay let\\'s come backwhen things go well tomorrow.  When we get there  Yes.  Tell me.  Sure yes.   Don\\'t throw up. Okay.  Oh this kid gosh...  Should we look for more?  Or you can quit.You can send him for adoption.  Still...  Then  we can raise him.  We?  The four of us...  The five of us withHaejin that sounds nice.  What a weird family.Who\\'s father is who\\'s dad?  I\\'ll be Woosung\\'s dad.  That\\'s what people usually saywhen they propose you know?  Is that so?  I wish I could start over like that.  But it won\\'t work.  I\\'m gonna be arrested soon.  Moon a prostitute in Busan  killed a man and ran away.  When the baby got in the wayshe throws it away in the baby box.  Does it come out like this?  They don\\'t blur the face these days.  Oh yeah?  It shook a bit right?  It\\'s okay. It\\'s becausewe\\'re at the top.  I\\'m scared \\'causeI can\\'t see anything.  It\\'s weird...  I feel a bit relaxedwhen I see you.  Why is that?  My mother...  I thought there might bea reason why she had to abandon me.  But still...  You don\\'t have to forgive her.  Because it doesn\\'t changethe fact that she\\'s a terrible mother.  That\\'s why.  I will forgive you instead.  Woosung will never forgive me.  You threw away Woosung  because you didn\\'twant to make him a murderer\\'s child.  But still  I threw him away.  I guess I was the onewho wanted to sell him the most.  We\\'re more like brokers.  Was it when you were young?  You were in my arms  you almost threw up but...  You didn\\'t throw up.I hugged you against my stomach.  I don\\'t remember.I was  years old.  Has it been that long?  How can you solvesuch a difficult question already?  Why? Who is it?  Mom.  Why? Answer it.  What? Is it a text message?  Text her back.  Should we take aselfie and send it to her?  It\\'s fine.  Here\\'s your order.Enjoy your meal.  Dig in. It looks delicious.  Dad will havea lot of money coming tomorrow.  Then like in the past  the three of us in Busan.  Oh daddy can come to Seoul...  Now that you have moneyplease don\\'t contact me again.  That\\'s what mom said.  Mom did...  But she seriously told medon\\'t ever come back home.  Last time daddy was so drunk.  Oh this straw is  a heart. It\\'s shaped like a heart.  You know what  the baby\\'s going to be born soon.  Mom\\'s?  Yes a boy.  Oh I see.  Well then tell yourmom congratulations.  Sorry.  Oh don\\'t be.  But I\\'ll continue to be your dad.  Right?  Really?  Of couse.  I better go.  Let\\'s meet again.  Steak steak...  Should I try that?  Anyway I wish you success tomorrow...  Here.  Here...  Woosung say \"Haejin hyung.\"  \"Haejin hyung. Haejin hyung.\"  Oh He said Haejin.  That must be you.   Woosung did you? Right? That\\'s right he did.  Woosung you must never forget it.  He will forget it soon.  You just have to remember everythingeven on Woosung\\'s behalf.  Gosh this kid. No matter howyou look at it he\\'s really unfortunate.  I totally agree.  Woosung we really had fun today  so let\\'s not forgetabout today in the future.  So young doesn\\'t talk to Woosung.  No?  No I\\'ve never seen it before either.  It\\'s the last day. Say something.  What should I say?  Well anything.  Well \"Thank you for being born.\" there.  Well people usually saysomething like that what?  He doesn\\'t even understand anything.  Even if he doesn\\'t understand  he would want tohear it at least once...  Sister then tell us everything.   Everything? Yes.   Everything here? Yes  This idiot.  I\\'ll pass.  What?  If she talks first to him...  Then I\\'ll pass too.  Fine I\\'ll talk to him.  Everyone close your eyes then.  WWait wait a second  Let\\'s turn off the light.  What hey  If you turn off the lightsHow can I eat my steak...  Hey Don\\'t turn off the lights.  Don\\'t turn it off...  Okay I\\'m going to start.  Haejin thank you for being born.  Sanghyun  thank you for being born.  Dongsoo  thank you for being born.  Woosung  thank you  for being born.  Soyoung  So young thank you for being born too.  Now now let\\'s sleep everyone.  Good night.  I\\'ll make a suggestion.  Let\\'s say you turn yourself in.  What?  Woosung...You don\\'t have to sell him anymore.  What you said to sell himand now I shouldn\\'t?  If you turn yourself in  you\\'ll be on parolefor the first time in three years.  Then you can live withWoosung again someday.  Those two people  cannot become parents I\\'m afraid.  I agree.  The couple I met today was like that.  Woosung is not abandonedhe\\'s a protected child.  He\\'ll grow up talkingabout that every day.  I hope Woosung grows upunder that kind of people.  Then..  Then..  He doesn\\'t have to live like me.  Where are you going?  Soyoung isn\\'t here either.  So young is probably meetingwith the detectives outside right now.  Soyoung is not the type to sell us out.  No it can happen.  She\\'ll do anything for Woosung.  But  she can do that.  You too man. You\\'ll find outwhen you become a parent.  Will Soyoung  be able to start overif she sells us out?  Of course.  No matter what  with Woosung.  If you go aheadI\\'ll catch up with you in a while.  Hey come here.   Hey Taeho. Come here.   I need to talk to you. Come on.   Wait. Let go.  You haven\\'t given up yet?Hey wait.  Of course so don\\'t ask.  Hey think about it too.  If that woman raises that kidI don\\'t think he\\'ll grow up.  Would that make you happy? Huh?  Why are you pretending to be nice huh?  You\\'re just a broker.Seriously come on let go.   Oh seriously. I need to talk to you.  Hey come on.  Do business with mewith that  million won huh?  That\\'s bullshit.Why would I do that with you?  I don\\'t work with Dongsoo anymore.  What?  I don\\'t know what to do with them.  I don\\'t need them anymore...  She scolded mea lot for saying that yesterday.  You suddenly brought that up.  We\\'re being rude to his mother.  So uh  you can call us wheneveryou want to see him.  Please tell his mother please.  I don\\'t want to hide anything from him.  I think it would be okay  even if we would send away  Woosung to people like you.  Oh? Who is that?  Maybe Sanghyun.  Yes who are you?  This is the police.  No this is... What is this?May I help you?  I need you to come with meon charges of illegal child trafficking.  Honey.  You stay in there for a second.  Well wait a minute. I\\'ll go out...  Mr. Kim Dongsoo? You\\'re underarrest for human trafficking charges.  Dongsoo hyung  Where is Soyoung?  She turned herself in.  What about the other one?  I don\\'t know.   Take him away. Yes.  Let\\'s go.  iFortunately there were no casualties.  iThe fire accident atthe Incheon officetel turned out to be  icaused by an electric short circuit.  iIn other news  inew information about the bodyfound in an underground shopping mall  iin downtown Seoul early on the th.  iThe victim was identified as Shina gang member in Busan  iand the police were at a motelwhere the victim stayed.  iAbout  million won in cashhas been found.  iPolice are investigating the caseleaving the possibility open  ifor both crime and accident.  iAlso in the news today  icelebrating Family Month in Mayevents for families  iwere held all over the country.  iChildren in Seoul...

Should we try putting our feet in?  iMoon So young long time no see.  iSo young got out ofprison half a year earlier.  iI heard the good news.  iOn that day sheasked you to take charge  iof Woosung on theday you were in the car.  iIt\\'s been three years now.  It\\'s a fire truck.  iI will be waiting  iwith Woosung at the park in front  iof the newly openedBusan Skyland for an hour from   ion the th of this month.  iWe still don\\'t knowwhere Sanghyun is and what he\\'s doing  ibut I contacted Dongsoo and Haejin.

Aw damn it.  This guy I'm playing Wordswith Friends with is killing me.  Who is it?  I don't know.  But as a detective I'vecobbled together a profile...  Mids foulmouthedand extremely intelligent.  He's beat me  times in a row.  Let's make it .  Well smartass yearoldwas my second guess.  Hey Elka we should play.I'm really good at Scrabble.  You know what my nicknamewas in high school?  Pizza Face?  Back Brace?Four Eyes?  Yes.  But it was also Word Nerd.  While everyone elsewas drinking and dancing  at the prom I was at homeplaying Scrabble.  With my mom.  Okay everybody.  You can play your gamesbut let's keep the competition  at a friendly level.  Remember Wilbur's stayingwith us this week.  Oh I love when your grandsoncomes to stay.  He is such a sweet little boy.  Yeah he reminds me of myselfat that age back in Canada.  You know if he playshis cards right  he too may one day be captain  of the highschoolmapletapping team.  Have his pick.   Of the girls? No of the trees.  Well enough of my glory days.  We still have to figure outour presentation for tomorrow.  It's career dayat Wilbur's school.  Bob and I are gonna talkabout being detectives.  Shall we head backto the office?  No you go.I was gonna stop by that place.  Oh pick me up a thing.  Yeah but not the onewith the stuff.  HaNo what a mess.   Bye. Bye.  Wow.  You and Bob almost seemlike a couple.  What?No.  I mean Bob is great but thatspecial something is missing.  You knowhow when you love someone  there's sort of a glowabout them?  An aura?  Yeah.I want a guy that glows too.  I had a guy who glowed.  Sinatra.  Can you get through one daywithout mentioning  that you slept with Sinatra?  I can.  But I won't.  Hello all.

This woman is awesome.  Mwah.  Is he a friend of Wilbur's?  Make your jokes but datinga younger man is fantastic.  You know coming to Clevelandtook a few years off me.  And winning an Oscartook a few more years off me.  If I win a GrammyI could go to prom.  Or stay home and play Scrabble  'cause that's a fun night too.  Hey babe.It is so beautiful outside.  What if we kept goingand biked the lake route?  Unless you're not up for it.  Oh no I'm totally up for it.  No I'll... I'll meet youout there.   Bye. Bye.  What are you waiting for?  Uh my very younglooking legsseem to have seized up a little.  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa Baba baba \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa Baba baba \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa Hey \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00aa  Finally.George Clooney is starving.

Oh I havea really good word too...  Kahl\\u00c3\\u00baa.  Oh I also have a really goodrecipe for Kahl\\u00c3\\u00baa.  Then why are we playingthis stupid game?  Well I hate to admit it  but Barney might bewearing me out.  Really?What'd you do last night?  Ugh we went to a midnight movieand then dinner after.  I was so tiredwhen the meal came  I might accidentallyhave eaten it.  Is there a food called nachosor was I dreaming?  Victoriamaybe it's time to admit  that he's maybe too youngor you're maybe too...  Bup bup bup bup I cannothear the end of that sentence.  Yeah when you get oldyour hearing goes too.  Well would a person who is oldbe going to meet her boyfriend  to play laser tag?  Oh my life.  So you see kidsour detective agency  specializes in cases of...  infidelity.  This woman here is the besthoney trap in the business.   Bob. Hmm?  Grandma?What's a honey trap?  Uh...  Wilbur let me explain.  Say you're a manand you have a cookie.  And you've had that cookiefor a while.  And it's just not makingyour mouth water anymore.  It's become dried upand... unappetizing.  That doesn't happento all cookies.  Some retaintheir gooey freshness.  Oh yes they do.  Anyway kids you golooking for a new cookie  your old cookie may get upset...  and hire us.  And the original cookie mightget a new car in the divorce.  That's right Mrs. Johnson.  It's Miss O'Roarke now.  Are you two married?  Well that'san interesting question.  No no no no no.  No uh we're colleagues.  I'm Wilbur's grandmotherand Bob is Wilbur's...  Bob.  It's true.I am his Bob.  Okay boys and girls.Time to retrieve your lunches.  Thank you for coming in todayMr. Moore and Ms. Scroggs.  Advertise your product or brand herecontact www.OpenSubtitles.org today   Here we go. Ah thank you.  You guys make the cutest family.  Oh we're not a family.  I mean Wilbur and Iare related but Bob is my boss.  Yes.  Like Colin Firthand his Portuguese housekeeper  in \\\"Love Actually.\\\"  Or Hugh Grant and his assistantalso in \\\"Love Actually.\\\"  A lot of people end up fallingin love with their bosses.  That was the messageof that movie.  So Wilbur I saw a big kidstep on your lunch.  That's Aiden.He does it every day.  I didn't see that.Wilbur why didn't you tell me?  'Cause big boys don't liketo be tattletales  do they Wilbur?  Yeah.  Sometimes he pushes me down.  You know if I taught youa little karate  you could fight backif you had to.  Or you could talk to Aiden  and tell himyou don't like being pushed  because fightingdoesn't solve things.  Hey cutie.  You want to see the machinethat made your milkshake?   Yeah Yeah  Bob.  You know what?I'm gonna talk to Melanie.  She did conflict resolutionat her kids' school in L.A.  She'll know what to do.  Bullies don't speakconflict resolution.  You've got to talk to themin the only language  they understand... force.  This may surprise youbut I once knew someone   who was bullied. It's you.  Yes but that was gonna bethe twist ending.  I would like to thankAiden's parents Pete and Kim  for joining us.  In conflict resolutionwe call this the talking stick.  The person holding itcan share their feelings  without any fear of judgment.  I'm confused.  If that's the talking stickwhat do we call Joy?  Oh I'm sorry.  II was up until  a.m.  You see I'm dating this guy  who's  years youngerthan I am.   years younger.Really?  Yeah he's .  Elka.  I've got the stick.I can say what I want.  That's not how the stick works.  Pete would you liketo start off?  Sure.  This whole thing feels likea lot of L.A. nonsense.  This is just a simple caseof boys being boys.  Young men have a lot of energy.  Huh that's for damn sure.  If you ask me your sonneeds to learn right from wrong.  Oh.Look who's preaching morality.  Aiden told us that you trap meninto doing things  by giving them cookies...  With your legs.  Give me that stick.I can explain.  First off...  yes Joy has amazing legs.  Long and shapelyand one can only imagine  what they'd feel like wrappedaround one's shoulders.  Bob  Sorry.What was the question?  Why does everyonewant boys to act  like wellbehaved little girls?  Pete's right.  I have a purse full of pills  the pediatricianwants me to give Aiden.  But I'm not gonna give my kidAdderall.  Adderall you say?  Isn't that what college kidstake to stay up all night?  This is a waste of time.  I say we just let the kidswork it out for themselves.  Oh so you plan to do nothing?  You're happyto just let your evil spawn  continue to bully my grandson?  Let's go Pete.  Oh that's great.Just walk away.  Just know that if yourlittle thug lays another hand  on my sweet grandchild...   Control your wife Bob. We're not a couple.  I'm not his wife.  Not yet.  What are you doing?How is that helpful?  Oh Joy calm down.  Oh... my... God.  Did you just ask a womanto calm down?  I don't remember.II don't think so.  Look I thinkwe should go back to my plan  of Wilbur defending himself.  I already told you...I don't want that.  Look we should just sit downtogether and talk through this.  But we're not together.We're not a couple.  I can't make it any more clear.There is no \\\"we\\\" Bob.  And there never will be.  Okay.  But that doesn't stop mefrom caring about Wilbur.  That's sweet.  When it comes to usyou have got to move on.  I hear you.  Maybe I ought to head upto Canada for a couple of days.  Take some walks in the woods.  Tap a few trees.  Mmm.  I am much better at Kahl\\u00c3\\u00baathan I am at Words with Friends.  And the great thing about ourKahl\\u00c3\\u00baa is I don't feel drunk  because we putextra coffee in it.  And I don't feel wired becausewe put extra vodka in it.  Oh poor Wilbur being bullied.  You know I had a bullywhen I was a kid.  Kaylin Boosalis.  I had a bully too.  Adolf Hitler.  You know I am two Kahl\\u00c3\\u00baas awayfrom calling that jerk  and giving hera piece of my mind.  In gym class she used to stealthe basketball away from me  and bounce it off my head.  It was the worst.  Did you not hear me saymy bully was Hitler?  HeyYou're still up.  Victoria are you just gettingback from your date with Barney?  It was great.We went to see a band.  And then we dancedand then we walked home  instead of taking a cab.  Where did all this energycome from?  Oh Barney makes me feel young.  I'm exercising now so I havemy own natural reserves.  Plus I stole Adderallout of that bully mom's purse.  What?  You stole her pills?  Honey that's notwhat they're for.  Elka can you believe this?  All I got was a Starbucks cardfrom the dad's coat.  Why are you guys stealingfrom our guests?  Because they didn't bringa hostess gift.  Victoriayou should not need pills  to keep up with your boyfriend.  He should love youfor who you are.  Oh grow up Melanie.  Nobody loves anybodyfor who they are.  These pills are the only thingkeeping me going.  But I've only got one leftand I need it to get upstairs.  What am I gonna do?  I need to get more Adderallso that I can make it  through Barney's birthday party.  See he's the first onein our group turning   so it's a big one.  Oh Joy honey I'm sorry.Did we get you up?  No. I couldn't sleep.Just feeling anxious.  About Wilbur?  No I'm gonna talkto his teacher tomorrow.  Honey why do you keepchecking your phone?  Well Bob usually texts meat night.  He lays outthree pairs of pajamas  and I pick the ones I like.  I mean I'm glad he stopped.  It's just weirdnot to get the text.  It's a little weird either way.  Just admit it... You miss Bob.  It's not that.I'm just used to him.  But I don't wantto think about Bob.  I should be concentratingon Wilbur.  You know what might be helpful?  Getting a prescriptionfor Wilbur for Adderall.  What?  I wouldn't give him Adderall.  Oh and I wouldn't want you to.  And the bully is Aiden.  I'm not surprised.  That kid's a soul patch awayfrom getting expelled.  So what do we do?  The school has a whole process.  Witness reports evaluations.  I got to tell you...It could take weeks.   Weeks? I'll go get the forms.  Wilbur?Did you throw that snowball?  You're not supposed to letpeople know your strength.  What?  When you lose your temperyou can really hurt people.  Now I want you to promisenever to do it again.  And shake on it.  AahToo hard.  You know the doctor saidthose gamma rays  made you superstrong.  Is Wilbur the Hulk?  I'm not allowed to say.  But yes.  Just don't make him angry.  Don't make him angry.  Oh.  All right.  Enough of that.You go play.  Thank you guys for comingto my birthday.  And thank you Victoriafor making this happen.  Being with youmakes me so happy.  And being with youmakes me so...  tired.  You passed outin the birthday cake?  Oh it was awful.  Just as I was thinking \\\"This isone of the worst moments  of my life\\\"the waitress asked me  if I'd be payingfor my son's birthday party.  Oh I'm sorry...  I wasn't there.   So you broke up with Barney? Yeah.  I mean dating a younger guyis like driving a convertible.  It's fun at first but thenyou realize your hair is a mess  you're sunburnt and everyoneassumes you rented it anyway.  Hey Joy.Where you been?  Out driving around.  Trying to sort throughsome feelings.  I saw it.  I saw the aura.  I think I'm in love with Bob.  What changed things?  He clobbered a yearold witha snowball to protect Wilbur.  It was the most romantic thinganyone's ever done for me.   Is the kid hurt? Who cares?  I'm in love.  And I'm finally seeingwhat everyone else  was already seeing...  We're a couple.  I used to think\\\"He's not Simon. He's not Mitch.  He's Bob.\\\"  But now I think\\\"He's not Simon. He's not Mitch.  He's Bob.\\\"   Aww Aww  She is so gonna say \\\"aww\\\"when she wakes up.  Oh Bob.  I'm so glad you're here.  Joy this is a surprise.  There's so muchI need to tell you.  I was at the school today andI saw what you did for Wilbur.  Oh.I'm sorry.  I know you told me to butt outbut it's just...  he was on my mind the whole timeI was in Canada...  No no.No I loved it.  And I'm sorry aboutwhat I said the other night.  Joy you never needto apologize to me for anything.  Sure I crieda few manly tears at first  but... then inthe bracing Saskatchewan cold  who should I run intobut my old girlfriend?  Canadian Joy.She...  Oh.Sorry to interrupt.  No not at all.You two should meet.  Joy Joy.Joy Joy.   Joy. Joy.  Hey babe I couldn't getthe vending machine to work.  Ah that machineis temperamental.  That's why I treat itlike a woman...  Just keep putting money into ittill it gives me what I want.   He's funny. Cut the crap Cleveland Joy.  I know you want himbut he's mine.  You make one move on himand I'll chop you up  and feed you to my sled dogs.  Damn my hand is stuck  Be right there Bob.  Isn't he cutest?  Say yes and I'll kill you.  Well that's the lastof the Kahl\\u00c3\\u00baa.  Should we make some more?  Oh I don't know.  I drunk dialed my old bullylast night  and lefta long and rambling message.  Oh I wouldn't worry about it.Maybe she didn't get it.  Hey Melanie.Are you in there?  It's her.It's my bully.  I guess she got it.  Melanie.  H.  H Kaylin.What a surprise.

Cover me.  Sounded like a dumb idea.  But I gotta hand it toyou Murdock it works.  Pioneers used to do it all thetime with them covered wagons.  They called themprairie schooners.  You see what you do isyou take the wind factor...  the humidity leveland the temperature...  and you divide that by thesquare footage of your sail...  then you multiply that bythe weight of your vehicle.  And then you just hope and pray  that that wind keepsblowing Hoppy.  So according to this map weonly have a couple more miles to go.  I sure hope weget there in time.  Heidiheidiho  Yes sir.

Interesting.  Yunhe.  What have you found?  I think there's nothing unusual.  One more lesson.  When you judge a person study not only his appearance but also what he wants to hide.  Lishu.  Wisteria tree?  What are you doing?  Sanyue.  What's the day today?  th day of the month.  Going outside at night is not allowed.  Go back.  Well punish me.  In fact I should punish you.  At the same day three years ago I met you. Do you forget?  I should give you a gift today.  There was also a Wisteria tree where we first met.  When I found it in the valley I wanted to give you a surprise.  It's also unsuitable.  If someone discovers you'll be in trouble.  It's you who are the most unruly and fell in love with me.  Don't worry.  Just two of us tonight.  Just tell me...  if you like my gift.  How will you repay?  What are they doing?  I...  Is that true?  Lishu was nibbling Xue Sanyue's lips.  Xue Sanyue is usually indifferent.  But she's no different from any other in terms of love.  How dare they?  Once Zhuyan seduced Earth Immortals into rebellion.  After it was suppressed the control over Earth Immortals was strengthened.  Especially in Flower Valley in charge of training and defense.  To avoid favoritism due to affection spiritual masters mustn't fall in love with Earth Immortals.  Shall we report them?  In Flower Valley no one can survive without support.  We should make friends with them.  Master.  Commander Xue. I've sealed off this place.  No entry.  Guardian J go back.  I'm here not to see the merman but you.  Commander J we don't seem to have much friendship.  Yesterday I saw something under the wisteria tree.  Take it easy Xue.  If I want to make trouble I won't come to see you.  I should have told Master Qingshu directly.  What do you want?  Cooperation.  You're courageous and abide by morality.  Me too.  Since we're the same why not help each other?  You're good at judging others' inner thoughts.  But you fail to find that I hate being threatened.  Since you saw that I must kill you.  Come with me Go  Sanyue. Pay attention to the merman.  He was caught by J Yunhe.  He won't fight.  Lishu.  Keep away.  It's my turn.  Don't hurt her  A merman speaks because of you?  What happened?  Young Master.  Someone saw J Yunhe and Xue Sanyue enter Reflection Cave.  I'm afraid there's something unusual.  They're coming  Big trouble is coming.  Lin Haoqing heard some news.  He's coming from there with a group of people.  Endless trouble today.  Lishu. They three must die today.  You  Why are you so naive?  Why not make peace?  It's not easy.  I want but...  Commander Xue. Could you calm down and talk with me?  It's meaningless.  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab In the corridor at the end of the world \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab I seem to see us there out of the corner of my eyes \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab I once bloomed like a flower \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab Meeting outside a pavilion full of flowers \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab We once met like a song in the sounds of nature \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab What is left blank is my love confession \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  Commander Xue. See?  Chang Y and I are lovers.  We both violated the rules.  So I won't report you.  Can you believe me?  Chang Y. Lin Qinghao is coming.  Hide inside.  They're coming  So many people here.  Commander Xue you said no one is allowed to enter.  Commander Xue.  How to explain?  Chang Y and I are lovers.  We both violated the rules.  So I won't report you.  Can you believe me?  I'm sure Guardian J broke into the cave.  You went too far  Stop.  I once heard J can let the merman speak.  Out of curiosity I asked her to come to confirm that.  Young Master's attendant is really selfassertive.  Before he speaks you declared J guilty.  You want to confirm that merman can speak?  OK.  Everyone in the valley trusts you. You won't play favoritism.  Prohibition for three days.  It's the rule you made.  Pay attention to discretion  so as to avoid giving grounds for talk.  Well.  Since there's no misunderstanding now  let's leave.  Sanyue.  Lishu.  Step aside.  What's your purpose?  Why must you cooperate with me?  Commander Xue.  If it's connected to your life  will you be confused for good  or risk your life to wake up?  Is there a frost mark on the back of your neck?  So what?  It's a sign for spiritual masters here.  Every new spiritual master must be planted this mark  by Master to show loyalty to Flower Valley.  Loyalty?  OK.  Let me show you what the loyalty is.  Where are we?  Freezing cold.  Why have I never heard of such an evil place?  It's hidden by Flower Valley on purpose.  It's also the last destination for all those with cold frost.  Cold frost?  Just the mark on the back of your neck.  It's not just a sign.  It's a name.  It is a frost flower from a very cold place.  Once it's planted  a mark seal hard to break forms.  Each time the frost appears  it freezes the meridians  and blocks your spiritual power  causing great pain.  Cold frost is a trick for Lin Canglan  to control all the spiritual masters here.  During these years  he puts me into an important position  and teach me ostensibly.  In fact he wants to stimulate the frost inside me.  I have to suffer a lot every time to get the antidote.  If so  why has my frost never been unusual?  As long as you are obedient and at his disposal  he will let you take the antidote  without your knowledge.  But Commander Xue.  Are you willing to be manipulated all your life?  Master raised me up.  Why should I believe you?  Lin Canglan has ruled Flower Valley  for hundreds of years.  Do you remember that  there are always some spiritual masters  that leave in a sudden?  Of course.  Master said those who are unwilling to stay  shall leave after erasing the frost sign on their own.  Flower Valley won't stop them.  If you don't believe me  try to erase it.  Sanyue  The frost she mentioned is true  Understand?  No one can erase the seal.  Since it was planted in your body  you've been a chessman of Lin Canglan.  All rebellious people will finally be brought here  into endless ice and eternal sleep  so it is particularly cold here  which is called Cold Grave.  Master.  Please be lenient on me.  Master show some mercy.  Please be lenient on me.  I won't violate your orders Master.  Master.  Be lenient on me.  Master.  Master.  Remember.  This is the consequence of betraying Flower Valley.  Once upon a time Flower valley was a paradise.  But now it's a place where Lin Canglan imprisons us.  In fact  we're even not as free as an Earth Immortal.  You kept it under wraps for years.  Why do you tell me in a sudden?  Because I want a friend  who will never betray me  and escape from Flower Valley together.  Haven't you ever thought about leaving here  and living the life you want?  You can also stay with the man you love  instead of meeting him secretly late at night.  It's too dangerous.  I can't risk Lishu's life.  Sanyue.  I'm not afraid of risks.  I'm only afraid that your life is always manipulated by others.  That's more terrible than death to me.  J Yunhe.  I believe your story.  But I don't trust you.  I'm not sure if you really loves a merman.  You saw that just now.  He and I have...  A kiss can't prove anything.  I can't entrust the life of Lishu and me to an unreliable person.  You must prove you really love each other.  Well...  When the spirit of Monster Fe made trouble  Chang Y was locked up in Reflect Cave.  He's at odds with me.  You want me to prove?  I'm afraid...  I'm afraid it's the best chance.  I'll prove we love each other deeply in three days.  We're absolutely reliable.  OK.  During the three days  you shall see him secretly.  But if I find you cheat me three days later  I'll kill you.  Well.  Terrible.  You kissed a merman recklessly.  You make your bed  so you must lie on it.  If I didn't do that  we would have been killed.  Do you really want to make an alliance with Xue Sanyue?  She's quite strong.  If we make an alliance with her  we'll have more chance to escape from Flower Valley.  But how will you please Mr. Fish?  First you cheated him.  Then you kissed him.  Now you want him to play a trick with you?  I'm worried.  Bigtailed fish.  I had no choice but to treat you in that way.  If you help me this time  I'll raise you  with lots of meat and wine.  Chang Y is my lover.  J Yunhe.  It's your fault.  You deserve it.  But...  maybe it's easy to please him.  Bigtailed fish.  Are you still angry after one night?  It's important.  You should be angry.  I made a big mistake.  But...  It was too urgent yesterday.  I had no time to think carefully so I kissed you.  Don't be angry.  Could you forgive me?  You can imagine you were bit by a dog.  Dog?  Are you angry because that was your first kiss?  It's also my first kiss.  Bigtailed fish.  Smelly  You've been locked up for days. You're smelly  What about a bath?  I'll treat you well.  If I can make you happy  will you forgive me?  OK.  That's a deal.  I'm sure you'll take a good bath.  You won't have any loss.  Although there's not much water  it's better to have than not.  Let me help you.  Come on.  Is that OK?  With water are you happier?  As long as you forgive me  I can do anything for you.  Tell me what you want.  Your apology etiquette is really special.  Do you like it?  Come on.  Are you touched?  It dropped inside.  Let me help you.  Come on.  J Yunhe and Xue Sanyue looked strange that day.  Are they plotting anything secretly?  Any progress?  You failed again?  During the three days you've pleased him many times.  You've tried anything including food drink and toys.  Many of my spirit stones have been wasted.  How long will that fish keep up appearances?  Come on. Three days will pass.  Xue Sanyue will go to Reflect Cave to prove your words soon.  Luo Luo.  I offered to train the merman.  Am I wrong?  I used to be quite confident  that I can see people's inner thoughts easily.  But I don't know what to do when I meet Bigtailed Fish.  Will I fail this time?  Stop.  You never give up easily.  You said we should stand in one's shoes.  You're the same as that fish.  I'm sure you know how to make him happy.  I'm the same as him?  He's the most stubborn merman.  Meantime you're the most stubborn spiritual master.  You're both controlled but unwilling to surrender.  You're the same.  Come on.  I'll give you a bowl of sweet soup.  After you drink it  go to Reflect Cave again.  And this bowl of soup is for him.  He's a lonely fish.  He has no friend or family on earth. So unfortunate.   Here you are.  Luo Luo.  You are the smartest person in the world.  I know that.  Here you are.  I have an idea.  Won't you have the soup?  No  I'll have the soup.  Bigtailed fish.  It doesn't matter if you don't forgive me.  It's my fault.  During these days  I've always been thinking about  how to please you with nice food and something interesting.  But I failed.  In the end  I just have such a worthless thing.  I don't know other mermen.  I don't know what mermen like.  However  people who are displaced and lonely  should miss home most.  Although this conch is not as precious as other magic instruments  it's said that you can hear the sound of sea in it.  Hope it can make you happy when you're lonely.  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab Each pair of eyes belongs to a merman \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab A drop in the ocean \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab Time is dreamy and turns into scales \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab The Milky Way ripples \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab I'm flying in the Milky Way like wind \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab Passing through the sea of stars \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab Enter the forest of light \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab Leap over the stream in the sky \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  Why are you... so nice to me?  Because...  Because I like you.  I like you.  I like you.  I like you.  I like you.  I appreciate you.  I want to be your lover.  I want to be with you all the time.  But...  We're not familiar.  But you help and protect me.  You show me everything of you.  Bigtailed Fish.  Love has nothing to do with the time length.  It only relies on your heart.  And you?  Do you like me?  Will you think of me from time to time?  Do you want to be with me?  Shall I kiss you one more time  to make you more clear?  Father said I should hug the loved one before kissing.  Be careful.  Rules.  Sanyue.  You're always lonely.  What's your feeling to have an ally?  Just out of common interests.  We're allies no need to be friends.  Now are we...  Do you want to say we love each other?  Chang Y.  You're not used to the language on shore yet.  It's a book on shore with characters and pictures.  It can help you learn our language quickly.  It's said that you mermen are smart.  I'm sure you'll learn quickly.  Luo Luo and I will come to teach you when free.  Any progress?  Did he believe?  Yunhe. Why are you unhappy?  I'm fine.  A bit tired.  Since he believes in you  shall we persuade him into cutting off his tail?  So quickly.  Quickly?  We must win twice to have the chance to win in the end.  Yunhe what's wrong?  I'm fine.  Go on.  I have an idea.  Your Encyclopedia is of a little use.  It includes a lot of nice food and many interesting things.  You can tempt him  that he can get anything on shore  and you want to enjoy life with him.  I'm sure he'll give up his tail and go ashore.  It's you who want to have fun outside.  I'm not such a person.  Anyway tell him the life on shore is much better than that in the sea.  Shall I take her back to the sea  since I like her?  The prohibition period is over.  The following three days belong to you.  But three days later  it will be the turn of Lin Haoqing.  Thank you Xue.  Don't be close to me.  I have no interest.  No.  Why?  As long as you go ashore  you can enjoy lots of table delicacies from land and sea.  Why not?  Food from land is not yummy.  As to the latter I can find them in the sea.  No need to go ashore.  Strange.  Why are you speaking so fluently overnight?  Yunhe.  What did you do yesterday?  Did you teach him to speak secretly?  Did she nibble your lips?  Don't talk nonsense.  Bigtailed fish.  Apart from food  there are many interesting things on shore.  One more thing.  The sea must be dark and you can't see anything.  The sea is not as bright as the land.  I live in a big clam.  There is a big pearl inside  that shines on itself  and can illuminate everything.  Just a pearl.  How big?  Nearly the same size as you.  So big  You must be upset inside.  The clam shell I live in is ten times bigger than here.  Father's residence is also larger than Flower Valley.  If you like it  I can take you back to the sea.  Bigtailed Fish.  Is there anything on shore that you don't have in the sea?  Father said the cunning villains on the shore  are greedy for fish's tail.  No such person in the sea.  Why do you mermen cherish such a flashy tail?  Is it that important?  The tail is the source of our spiritual power.  Unless we volunteer  our tail will not break  even if it's chiseled with a knife or axe.  But once the tail is broken  we'll lose much spiritual power  and won't be able to return to sea anymore.  The loss of a tail has such terrible consequence.  You can't even go home?  If a merman breaks the tail he'll feel like being burnt in water.  We'll consider him a betrayer.  So father said we'd rather die than break the tail.  Yunhe.  Shall we have a tail and enter the sea?  I have something to do. We should leave.  What's the matter?  Luo Luo.  She's angry.  Did I say anything wrong?  But once the tail is broken  we'll lose much spiritual power  and won't be able to return to sea anymore.  If a merman breaks the tail he'll feel like being burnt in water.  We'll consider him a betrayer.  In the very beginning  my goal was to tame mermen.  But why was I so sad when hearing that he won't be able to go home  once the tail is lost?  Sanyue.  My swordsmanship is not as good as yours.  But we cats do better in cooking fish.  Do you know that  men plough and women weave in the human world?  We don't have such rules.  As long as you like  laundry and cooking are full of happiness.  By the way  I don't have much power.  If I'm not good at cooking  how can I be your husband?  Commander Xue.  Commander Xue.  Yunhe said we're allies.  We should help each other.  Just out of interests.  I won't help her.  I'm here not to see you but Lishu.  You want me to teach J Yunhe  to attract Chang Y more?  I can't say more.  In a word only if Chang Y likes Yunhe more  will he go ashore willingly.  By the way  among us  you know best what love is.  Why?  You can even win Xue Sanyue's heart  So I'm sure you have ideas.  Or I can give you some spirit stones.  Considering your weak power you need them.  Come on little butterfly.  Save your stones.  Since you trust me  I'll do you a favor.  But it's no use teaching J Yunhe.  It's that dull fish that should learn.  A cat teaches a fish?  Will he agree?  You don't understand.  Yes. You know the best.  I want to help you but you don't buy it.  I shouldn't have come to teach you.  There's feud between us two clans.  Why do you want to help me?  If you make up with J Yunhe  I'll be able to escape Flower Valley with Sanyue and lead a happy life.  By the way  aren't you upset since J Yunhe is at odds with you?  Don't you want to see her bright smile again  as soon as possible?  You have little spiritual power. How to teach me?  When it comes to love  fighting is useless.  When I first met Sanyue  I was nearly killed by her.  I was once a king in a mountain and admired by people.  At that time Sanyue fought with a beast  and was badly hurt.  When she passed by Mountain Qiongling  I met her by chance.  Rascal   Awake?  Let me go  It's hard to meet a beauty.  I can't let you go.  I need a wife.  Are you willing to be my wife?  Is she dead?  It's Cold Pond Fish soup.  Shall I cook for you everyday?  Beauty.  Beauty. Don't beat me.  You'll be ugly with injury.  Have a good rest.  I'll cook fish soup for you everyday OK?  When Sanyue was nearly cured  my men found her.  They were afraid that a spiritual master  would cause endless danger.  So they forced me to send Sanyue to the beast she hurt.  Take out the spiritual master  Yes Take out  She's a spiritual master. Take her out   Ask her to go out  Take her out Hurry up   She's a spiritual master  Take her out  If you protect her...  I don't mind if she is a spiritual master.  She's my treasure.  You can beat me.  We've endured you a useless leader for a long time.  Let's go  We'll leave such a bad place  Go  Go  Beauty.  Today's fish soup is very fresh.  I thought Sanyue woulld never return.  So I decided to leave Mountain Qiongling  to make a living.  Beauty?  Am I daydreaming?  Why are you back?  Except Mountain Qiongling  where else can you go?  I'll find a place sooner or later.  I lost my stockaded village.  So I can't catch you as my wife.  Beauty.  Shall I follow you?  I was driven away because I saved you.  You should be responsible for it.  How?  I need nice food and sugared words.  Then I'll follow you in every corner of the world.  In fact I can live without nice food.  It's easy to raise me.  As long as you accept me  I'll take care of you.  Shall I cook fish soup for you everyday?  Please talk to me.  How about that?  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab Each pair of eyes belongs to a merman \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab A drop in the ocean \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab Time is dreamy and turns into scales\\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab The Milky Way ripples \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab I'm flying in the Milky Way like wind \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab Passing through the sea of stars \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab Enter the forest of light \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab Leap over the stream in the sky \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab My shadow is like a smile curve \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab My heart leaves a projection \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab The projection of a world \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab My leap reflects the mountaintop \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab From the sun the moon to the dust \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab I just want to come and go with love \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab My heart leaves a projection \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab The projection of a world \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab The will of heaven is disclosed \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab The love remains silent \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab My heart leaves a projection \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab The projection of a world \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab The sky is slightly rolled up \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab The longings emerge from the sea \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab The heart of infinity turns into scales \\u00e2\\u0099\\u00ab  ap.OpenSubtitles.org is deprecated pleaseimplement REST API from OpenSubtitles.com\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

            "    In the name of God the most gracious the most Merciful.  From Muhammad the Messenger of God  to Heraclius the emperor of Byzantium.  greetings to him who is thefollower of righteous guidance.  I bid you to hear the divine call.  I am the messenger of God to the people;  accept Islam for your salvation.  He speaks of a new prophet in Arabia.  Was it like this when John the Baptistcame to king Herod  out of the desert crying about salvation?  To Muqawqis Patriarch of Alexandria.  Kisra emperor of Persia.  Muhammad calls you with the call of God.  Accept Islam for your salvation...  embrace Islam.  You come out of the desertsmelling of camel and goat.  To tell Persia where he should kneel?  Muhammad Messenger of God.  Who gave him this authority?  God sent Muhammadas a mercy to mankind.  The Scholars and Historians of Islam The University of AlAzhar in CairoThe High Islamic Congress of the Shiat in Lebanon  The makers of this film honour the Islamic traditionwhich holds that the Impersonation of the Prophetoffends against the spirituality of his message.  Therefore the person of Mohammadwill not be shown.   years after Christ died  iwhen Europe was sunk in the dark ages  iand everywhere the oldcivilizations were falling  iMuhammad was bornin Mecca in Arabia.  iMecca was then a rich tradingcity ruled by its merchants  iwhose wealth was multipliedby a unique privilege...  ithey housed the gods.  iEvery year at thetime of the great fair  ithe desert priests brought their idols  iand the images of their godsinto the custody of the Kaaba.  iOnce the most holy shrine of Abraham  ithe Kaaba had nowbecome a house of idolotry  ihosting no fewer than different gods.  iMecca in  A.D.  Bilal  Have you had today's count Umaya?  Not yet...  but this year the Gods are gold.  When you put the Gods and Prophet togetheryou sit very pretty between hmm?  And more gods to place in the Kaaba.  Caravan from Syria.   Hmm...they must have been running. They'll be thirsty.  Put five more men on north wells.  How many sheep shallI have to kill for them?  ?  Give them a hundred.  Mecca must keep hername for hospitality.  And ten lambs for the leaders.  Bread and waterdo the poets have in the Hakim's house?  Where verse and prose arenightly put to slaughter.  And...and the bread I swear in there  is thinner than the water  Oh...open the space open the spaceyou lovers of poetry  to Abu Sufian willing and which...  patron of the arts.  When Abu Sofyan invites the poet in  their joy is kit and love is kin.  Where wines and cakes abound  the skills of Abu Sofyan.  All revels and all songs begin  when Abu Sofyan invites the poet in.  From the silkworms of China my lady.  A pleasure to the limb...  and as my lady can seea ravish to the eye.  Yes  lengths.   dinars.  Abu Sofyan's wife?  .  Oh gold The gods of theKaaba have their needs  their upkeeps.  Who is that man who stood therewho looked into my soul?  Carry me away from here.  Why must Muhammad come down here?  Why don't you stop him?  He is your nephew.  Maybe he will change.  Change?  He is  years old.  It's unnatural...  with a rich wife he couldafford the best of Mecca.  Yet he chooses to sit shivering in a cave.  It is unnatural  For a man who dares torisk the anger of AlUzza  who keeps our health.  Manat the god of our prosperity.  Allat the god of ourfamily and tribes.  and Hubal...  Hubal who starts our caravansand predicts our fate.  To challenge the gods within earshotof the gods is dangerous.  Unreasonable.  Rebellious blasphemous.  Yes I'm afraid Muhammadwill harm himself.  I am always sadwhen the great fair is over.  I might not see the next one.  Abu Talib Abu Talib  Catch your breath Zaid  Has Muhammad come downfrom Mount Hira yet?  He's been up there three days.  No no I haven't seen him.  Khadijah hoped he might havecome to you on his way home.  Then he's still up there.  Three days.  I'm afraid for him on the mountain  because...  I don't know what it means.  iMen see the world too wellfrom a mountain.  Muhammad Read  In the name of thy Lord who createdman from His sensitive drop of blood.  Who teaches man what he knows not.  Read  He's still trembling under the blanket...  but he has spoken.  Zaid What happened tomy nephew on the mountain?  He was alone in the cave.  Suddenly an angel came in to him.  The angel said Read  Muhammad replied I can not read.  The angel commanded again Read  In the name of thy Lord  who created man fromHis sensitive drop of blood  who teaches man what he knows not.  Read  Who knows if it was Gabriel?  It could have been a dream.  When Muhammad was coming fromthe mountain he saw Gabriel plainly.  In the shape of a manstanding on the horizon.  Wherever he looked  upon every turn ofhis head he saw him.  And Gabriel said to him again  I am Gabriel...  and you Muhammad  are the Messenger of God.  Who has he told about this?  His wife  and Al  and his friend Abu Bakr.  And you?  I am his adopted son.  Be careful to whom you talk.  Tell him his uncle who protected himwhen he was a child will protect him still.  After all...  they say the God of Moses  spoke to him out of a burning bush.  If you do not restrainyour nephew then we will.  He's dividing the cityheart against house.  He's dividing the generationschild against parent.  The young are listening to him.  He attracts the young.  We are Arabswe obey our fathers.  Our children cannot be our teachers.  How can we accept that the manwe met in the street yesterday  can be some God's Prophet today?  Dead bones can live again he says  because He who created man  can also make man returnfrom the dead he says  The Gods might leave us andgive their benefits to another city.  Tell him...we will give himauthority position  and keys to the Kaaba  and money what money he wants.  Tell him we will givehim anything he wants.  Muhammad spare yourself...and me.  Do not put a greater burden onan old man that he can bear.  In your childhood you were in my arms.  I cannot now see you hurt.  If you refuse them...  they will hurt you.  He said this to me  Were they to put the sun in myright hand and the moon in my left  I would not renounce my message  which is from God.  When I am deadyou may do as you please  but whilst I'm aliveyou will obey your father  Why did you hurt our father?  If I were drunk every dayand played dice every night  you'd call it high spirits  You will be more mybrother than you are now  You are all my children.  I've given you everything I could  but it seems not to be enough.  Muhammad gives me more  he give all the world more.  Get him out of here father  It's not Waleed or meit's our father.  You tortured him.  Wait Hudayfa wait  How can they sayit's an invention Musab  when it isn't new?  In Mecca it's new.  Yet God has said it all before...  to Noah Moses Jesusto all the Prophets  but people changed itturned it forgot it.  Now God said it to Muhammad again...  and it is new again.  What is it?  It's Jafar.  What have you brought with you?  The very word of God.  When the sun is overthrown.  When the stars fall.  When the mountains vanish.  When the camels big withyoung are abandoned.  When the wild beasts are herded together.  When the seas rise.  When the souls are sorted.  When the female infantwho is buried alive  asks for what crime she was killed.  When the books are opened.  When the sky is torn away  then...  every soul...  will know what it has done.  Were you there Jafarwhen God gave him these words?  Dawn is coming up.  Ammar you first  then you Jaafar.  Ammar  You kept your mother awakeall night with worry.  I'm sorry father.  Where were you?  Have you been with Muhammad again?  What will happen now?  Forgive him it wasmy fault I did it.  That God has helped us all our lives.  But it fell...  it could not even help itself.  What talk have you been listening to?  The real god is unseen.  He's not made of clay.  Ammar we see the godsin the Kaaba every day.  I'm afraid for you.  You're listening to peoplewho will hurt you.  I'm listening to Muhammad mother.  Muhammad is generous yes.  He gives he shares  he'll pass no man without a smile  but he is spreading dangerous ideas.  Dangerous ideasthat no man should start?  That the rich should not afloat the poor?  The strong should not oppress the weak?  Are these dangerous ideas?  Girls should not be forced into marriage  but be able to choose or refuse.  By only tonight he said;  Stop the burial of newborn girls.  I was fortunate alwaysfortunate with your mother.  Yes but you know that you and Inearly never met Yasser.  And you were nearly never born.  I was to be buried  like my two sisters  but my father couldn't do it.  He couldn't do it the third time.  When the second girl was being...  when my father was putting sand over her  she took hold of his fingerthe way a baby does.  He told my mother afterwards  that it was a minute...  before the tender little grip eased...  and he dared take away his hand.  When I was born  my father ran out of the house  screaming that he couldn't do it again  that he could never do it again.  Sumayyah it is the custom.  But it's wrong.  The gods that let suchthings be are no gods.  I promised to go to Muhammad'shouse mama we pray there.  Yes He is a good man.  Yes...yes you go.  Two men are following him.  Read? Muhammad canneither write nor read.  But he can speak.  What did you say?  He can speak?  Well so can you so nowyou speak up young man.  What does Muhammad say umm?  They are God's words not his.  Which god's?  What words?  A speaking god?  Your Muhammadspeaks only to himself.  When God reveals Hismessage to Muhammad  he remembers every word  then he tells it to those who can write...  this is the Quran.  Muhammad has starvedhimself into dreams.  He hides under a blanketwith his eyes shut.  His eyes are shutbut his heart is open.  You Kick him for his cleverness.  There is no purpose in that.  Doesn't Muhammad realize welive by giving housing to the gods?  We own the Kaaba.  Every year the tribes ofArabia come here to Mecca  to pray and to buy from us.  Now were we to replace Gods with just one?  Whom we cannot even see who issupposed to be in Taif and Medina  here in my house  in Jerusalem on the moon?  Where would Mecca be then?  The gods are both ourworship and our revenue.  You cannot buy and sell God.  Young man you areclose to the whip.  Ammar be sensible boy.  I have a question.  Muhammad teaches youa slave is equal to his master.  This black Bilal who Ipaid money for...equal to me?  Yes Muhammad says...  before God all men are asequal as the teeth of a comb.  This is a very pleasant ideato slaves and beggars.  It gives them pretensions.  Bilal  Teach this man the differencebetween the Lord of Mecca and a slave.  Take that whip.  Lash his face toteach his mouth a lesson.  Whip him  Whip him  Cut him  Whip him  Do it Bilal  Obey them  They will kill you  See what anarchy they bring  They've even infected our slaves  If you're human enoughto have gods...  ...remember  They are the gods of your owner  I bought your humanity Bilalwhen I bought you.  You will be corrected  One one God.  There is only one God  Who is stronger now?  Your masteror this one god of yours?  One God.  There is only one God.  Bring the stones  One God.  One...  ...one God.  Crush him  Break him  Have you finished with him?  There is only one God   iOne God You could swear the slave was preaching   iOne God Lord Umaya  Abu Bakr will pay a dinars for this slave.  Wait now  It's against our social orderto sell a slave during his correction.  The offer is to Lord Umaya    If the price of slaves is raised  we shall have to bailourselves next year.  Take him  He is no use to me anymore  Kill him or take himI'm finished with him  We are declaring ourselves.  God has told his messengerto declare Islam to all men  Open the windows  Let the world hear  We are coming out of the darkness  Hear well the word of GodHear well the messenger of God  There are no other gods but Godand Muhammad is his messenger.  There are no other gods but Godand Muhammad is his messenger.  We have come into light  join us in the march to the Kaaba  God is most greatGod is most great  God has no partner  We have come into light  join us in the march to the Kaaba  Muhammad and his rebellioncalled Islam are coming out  to foul our godsand dethrone religion.  Don't let them reach the Kaaba  Throw them back Defend your gods  There is no god but Godand Muhammad is the messenger of God.  There is no god but Godand Muhammad is the messenger of God.  There is no god but Godand Muhammad is the messenger of God.  Protect the prophet  There is no god but Godand Muhammad is the messenger of God.  Guards  God is great  This is blasphemy you idiot  God is great  God is great  God is great  There is no god but Godand Muhammad is the messenger of God.  Now's the time to break themthere are only  of them.  No we've done enough.  More will only create sympathy for them.  God is great  iStand downiGod is great  God is great  In the name of Godmost gracious most merciful.  Say O you who reject faith  I worship not what you worship.  iKeep him out of the KaabaiI worship not what you worship.  iKeep him out of the Kaaba  iLead them out  Neither do you worship what  worship.iLead them out  Neither do you worship what  worship.  Silence you're a false prophetNeither do you worship what  worship.  Silence you're a false prophet  Finish Muhammad  Protect the prophetFinish Muhammad  Protect the prophet  Messenger of Godback to the corner  Hamza Hamza  You are brave.  He is the bravest man in the desert...  when he meets unarmed men.  Muhammad is...is a liar  Liar?  If you don't let him speak  Where's the lie and where's the truth...  when it hasn't been spoken yet?  Muhammad is a fraud  Stand up Hit me back if you dare  I affirm my nephew's religionand I say what he says  Whoever has the courage to fightfight with me  Muhammad when I hunt the desert at night...  I know God...is not kept in a house.  Who would have thought that Hamza  Hamza above all  with his wine drinking lion hunting...  would come to join Muhammad?  The more we attack himmore they seem to join him.  Where does he find his words?  I don't know.  How can an illiterate mango up on a mountain  and come down three days laterblazing with poetry?  If it were just poetry...  he says it's God.  How do we fight someone whosestrength we do not understand?  Muhammad promises heaventrees in the skies.  So naturally he's found an audience.  Then we must make that audienceless eager to listen to him.  We will begin with the weaker ones.  Your turn  Have mercy  Stretch her  Who is your God?Answer me  Say it  Say Hubal is your God  Say it  There is only one God  and Muhammad is the messenger of God  Oh my god  Ammar  Your father and motherare the first martyrs of Islam  You are promised paradise  How much are you men prepared to suffer?  The Prophet has said we must leave Mecca.  If you stay  they will kill you...  one by one.  Muhammad says that in Abyssiniathere is a Christian King.  No man is wronged in his country.  We must leave now today.  Uthman  God be praised  Let us go.  We found their tracksand followed them  but they just disappeared  They were there...in the desert under the vultures  and you let them escape you  Escape? They vanished  If Muhammad has stayedthen only the weakest have gone.  Weak or strongthey'll blacken our name.  We're honest merchantswe buy and sell in good faith.  We cannot afford scandal.  Abyssinia...  Amr  You are a friend of Annajash the king?  Yes.  Can you use that friendship?  I think I can bring them back...  yes.  Abyssinia...  Rise up Amr.  Please nothing you may askfor that we will not give.  Lion of Judah I...  I don't know where to begin.  You have our friendship  begin there.  Certain runaway slaves have escapedfrom us into your kingdom.  Slaves go back as you no doubtwould returned our slaves to us.  There are however somefree men among them...  rebels.  Rebels?  Disturbance in Arabiawhy am I not informed?  They are rebels in religion.  At one time or anotherall religions were rebellions.  The bodies of slaves of the worldand beaten are disposal.  But as Jesus Christ as our shepherd  the souls of men are his sheep.  These are Arabs who have betrayedthe religion of their fathers.  They follow a lunaticthey call...a Prophet.  But I cannot put souls intochains without hearing them.  Good they're stiffnext we'll hang them.  Do you not bow to yourselfbefore your prophet?  Muhammad is a man  we kneel only to God.  Where are Muhammad's miracles Jafar?  If he were a prophethe'd light the sky with miracles  Indeed this is true.  God has given his prophetsthe signs of miracles  that we may recognize them.  The miracle of Muhammadis the Holy Quran.  A book A book  Written by an illiterateattributed to God.  I think the emperor has had enough  I'm mindful of petty costs.  When God set down tongues of fireupon the heads of Christ's apostles  so they could speak themany languages of the world  that they knew not before.  But do such miracles happen in our times?  I've heard enoughYou've made a poor case.  When we suffered persecution in Mecca  Muhammad told usgo to Abyssinia  the land of the righteous kingwhere no man is wronged  What they call persecutionwas fair punishment  that is order now...  Why did your prophet send you to me?  Because you believe in the bookof the one God as we do.  He sent us because in your heartGod will protect us.  Talking with him is likedrawing water from a mirage.  But they've now belay that duty onme to listen to them my friend.  Go on  For years we worshipedwood and stone  images of our own manufacture.  We lived in ignorance of God.  We had few earthly lawsand no heavenly laws.  The rich neglect the poor.  And the natural pity of man  whereby he lifts his brotherup when he has fallen...  is described by them asupsetting social order  To this inhumanityhas come a man...  whom God chose...  and in that we believe.  You've overcome I begyou to collect yourself.  I speak of the messenger of God.  Muhammad teaches usto worship one god  to speak truth  to love our neighbors as ourselves  to give charityeven a smile can be charity.  To protect women from misuse  to shelter orphans...  and to turn away fromgods of wood and stone  I cannot keep still andhear this blasphemy  We are an ancient civilization...  to call our gods wood and stoneis to speak ignorantly of them.  The idol...the formis not what we worship  but the spirit that resides within the form.  I agree that idolatry is notalways fully understood.  Thank you.  Now let me bring him back to the women.  God made woman to be theproper companion of man.  She is different but equal.  Equal?  We buy them.  Feed them clothe them  use them discard them...  women equal to us?  God created man fromone male and one female.  Amr you must respect in allwoman the womb that bore you.  Why are your guards so tonguetied?  While this only guard is eloquent.  God has spoken to us before...  through Abraham Noah Mosesand through Jesus Christ.  Why should we be so surprised that Godspeaks to us now through Muhammad?  Who taught you those names?  They are named in the Quran.  I knew Muhammad when hewas an orphan minding sheep  And we knew Christ as a carpenter.  What Christ saysand what your Muhammad says  is like two raised from the same land.  They are lying to youthey deny Christ.  You worship three gods they say.Father Son and Holy Ghost they say.  What do you say of Christ?  They say God cannot have a son.  Christ is not the Son of God.  Speak to me of Christ.  We say of Christ whatour prophet has taught us...  that God cast his holy spirit intothe womb of a virgin named Mary  and that she conceivedChrist the Apostle of God.  The Apostle he saysnot the son not the son  What does your miracle your Quransay of the birth of our dear Lord Jesus Christ?  May I relate the words?  Come closer to me.  In the name of Godmost gracious most merciful.  Relate in the book the story of Mary.  How she withdrew from herfamily to a place in the east.  How we sent to her ourangel Gabriel who said  ''I am a messenger from your God\"  \"to announce the birthof a holy son to you.\"  She said \"How shall I Mary have a sonwhen no man has touched me?''  And Gabriel replied  \"For your Lord says it will happen.\"  We appoint him as a sign onto man...  and a mercy from us.  It is a thing ordained.  The difference between us and you  is not bigger than this line.  Not for a mountain of goldwill I give them up to you.  You may live in Abyssinia in peace  for as long as you wish.  May God's blessings be upon you  when you return.  lntolerable  Mohamed disturbs evenour foreign alliances  Very well  We will make a foreigner of him  Abu Talib  has his arms around him.  Very well  We will throw uncleand nephew out.  In one bundle his whole family out.  We will expel them from ourselves.  No merchant may trade with them.  No land remain to them.  No roof shelter them.  No beggar beg for them.  No woman marry them.  Until they renounce they can't.  iThese were the worstyears of Muhammad's life.  iFor three years they suffered the hungerthirst cruelty of the open desert.  iBut the year of grief was still to come  iwhen Khadija Muhammad'swife for  years died.  iWhen Abu Talibhis old Protector died...  iwith his last breath Abu Talib  itried again to reconcileMecca and Muhammad.  He never asked more from you...  ...than one word.  One...  one God.  If it were only a question of one wordwe would have given him ten words.  But the word he wantswould dethrone all the gods.  You were afraid even to hear him.  iWith the death of his uncleMuhammad has now lost all protection.  iHe was no longer safe in Mecca.  iAlone with Zaid his adopted sonhe went to the hillside town of Taif.  iHe asked to be taken into be allowed to preach.  iBut the children ofTaif were turned loose  ito stone him back into the desert.  What are you doing?  Stop Stop  Leave him alone Go away  iMuhammad called thisthe bitterest day of his life.  iThen miraculously  iwhen Muhammad's missionseemed to have failed  ihis entire situation changed.  iA deputation from the richbut selfdestroying city of Medina  imet him by night atthe rocks of Aqaba  iasking him to come to them  ito stand between their factions  ito mediate their continualquarrels and civil wars.  iMuhammad agreed...  iprovided they gave him a pledge  ithat they worship the one God only.  Wait  When we take this pledge we expelourselves from the rest of Arabia.  So wait  War is in this pledge.  We are to makeenemies of brothers.  We are to makefirewood of our gods  That is the meaning of the pledge.  If we take it there canbe no turning back...  for Muhammad is indeedthe messenger of God  foretold to us bythe Jews in our city.  So if anyone has doubtin this pledge go now.  And if you have no doubtsthen you do as I do.  I pledge myself tothe one and only God  and to you Muhammadthe messenger of God.  He is of us and we are of him.  Let him bring his followersour brothers to us to Medina.   Sync Corrections by i Pocong@LTT   iThis was a journeythat changed the world.  iThe Hijra or Flight to Medina.  iOnly  people  isplit up into small groups  iwalking  miles of desert.  iYet so profound were the consequences  iso lasting were the effects of this walk  ithat from it the muslimsdate their calendar.  iIn this moment Islam found it's future.  iMuhammad himself stayed inMecca in the greatest danger  iuntil all his followers had left safely.  Muhammad has become a nation  he has received a city  entering into pledges and treaties  and you Salool who claimto be king of Medina  lost the kingdom last nightwhile you were in bed  You should worry aboutyourself Abu Sufian.  Every time you trade awhiff of perfume out the city  you must creep pastthat man in Medina.  He is across yourmercantile throat so to speak.  And what do you intend to do?  l intend to wait.  And how long will you wait?  Till you and the rest of Arabia remove him  to save your way of life.  And while you wait?  I should accept his call of course.  Does he think I willgive him my birthright?  I will not.  Medina is worth the conversion.  Hypocrisy.  Of course it's...a healthy hypocrisy.  King Salool  wiping his face on the floor times a day praying?  I don't believe you.  He may not have to.  We'll do know what weshould have done before  kill Muhammad.  Come come and see.  They say that practiceleads to perfection.   young men eachfrom a different family  my own son Ikrima is with them.  They will stab him together.  If the responsibility for his deathis shared where lies the guilt?  My idea.  I'm not sure I'm part of it.  Muhammad's body contains too much...  his mind his words...  But it is an ingenious solution.  And a final one.  No  Al his cousin laid there to die for him?  Who are we fighting?  They cannot go far allthe tracks are watched.  He must take to the desert.  Bakkah will give camels to the man  who brings back Muhammad...  ...or his head  Look for  of them  Muhammad  Abu Bakr  and Uriqat his Bedouin guide.  What is it?  They're not grazing camel.  Maybe two days that from the city.  Why are you here?  Medina is to the north.  They make the tracks not I.  Nomads? Travelling west?  I know my art.  They say that you can tracka bird by smelling the air.  We go with them.  He may be in that cave over there.  Muhammad if you come outwe will take you to Mecca alive.  Muhammad come out  They can't be in therethis...this web is unbroken.  And these pigeonsthey would not build.  We were wrong to follow themwe should have gone north.  Let's move then.  We still have time to head them off.  iA few threads of a spider's web  iwere all that was then betweenMuhammad and murder.  iBut he was a man not to be killed.  iThe Bedouin guide led him and hiscompanion Abu Bakr in their escape  ithrough untracked spaces of the desertand the heat of the June days.  iAt Medina his followerswaited with their welcome ready  ibut in great fear for his journey.  Anything?  No nothing.  He himself says he is only a man.  No man can survive that heat.   There I see them Look  Run and hide.  I may be obligedto free you as a gesture.  Welcome to the cityof Medina the blessed.  Your city messenger of God.  You will stay with memessenger of God.  I have the best house in Medina.  You will give me thehonor of keeping you.  Stay with me  Please Please Please  How can the Prophet choosebetween so many welcomes?  Where God guides his camel to stopthere he will build his house.  All agreed?  We turn Quaswa his camel loose  and where Quaswa sits the Prophet stays.  Clever man.  A choice made by acamel can offend no one.  Here we will buildthe house of the Prophet.  And our first meetingplace a prayer house  The first mosque of Islam here  God is great God is great  What is the prophet of God doing?  Carrying bricks?  Give me that.  Look you are doing too much.  Please go and sit down...we'll do it.  Look He went for more.  \"Work is a worship\" he says.  He's  years old.  How old are you?  There is something missing.  Maybe a bell to call the people in.   The Christians use a bell? Mmm (yes).  What about a horn like the Jews?  A drum?  There's too much blood in a drum.  Why not the human voice...  as in Umar ibn Khattab's vision?  The Prophet agrees?  He means you Bilal.  Me?  You have a good voice use it.  Climb up there.  Brothers  Today a man of Medina  will embrace a man of Mecca.  Each will share half and half.  Reach out embrace yourneighbor and brother.  I'm tired of the politics ofkissing slaves read this  The prophet should concernhimself with the afterworld.  How is my son?  Praying like a horse.  Does it burn your hands?  If it's not torn upit will burn down the house.  He's making laws like a king.  He has declared that loyalty to Islamis more than loyalty to tribal family.  What?  All muslims are next of kin to oneanother?  Don't be mislead by that.  They must change thenature of the tribes before that.  The danger is here equality  a man's neighbour is as good as himself.  The lunatic means it  Jews and Christians haveequal rights with Muslims.  The Jews who attach themselves to acommon wealth shall be protected.   Women have rights of inheritance? Rights.  Next he'll be giving the camel rights.  He has The lunatic hasYou can't overload them.  He's remaking a city my city  Damn him  He's taken our sons from usour future from us.  His rights... are wrongs  No more.  This time... it willnot be just his riffraff.  We will take everything ofvalue they have left in Mecca.  Their rugs their houses their silver...  and with it a large of caravan to Damascus.  My friends listen to me  I have news from Mecca  Everything you have left behind is gone  The thieves  Abu Bakr's shopsthe prophet's house... sold  Every cup or piece of cloth  every rag or bone you everowned is thrown on the market.  You are a people of nothing.  Don't you even fight for what you own?  Who talks of the fight?  What other way is there Hamza?  When the Prophetsays fight we fight.  Now he says peace.  Exactly  You are a peace loving people  Up to your necks and forebearers.  Go back to work.  We have to defend ourselves.  You are the messenger of God.  Yet they mock...  abuse and plunder usand we do nothing.  In the package of war we are pathetic  But they are led by greed.  We are led by God...and you.  Now I...  I know how you hate the sword  but we have to fight.  They have stolen our property.  They are taking it to Damascusright past our own door.  I say by God get back  I'm sorry I'm carried away.  It's the pounding in my head.  Please... fight them  But... look at the sun.  It's not the time for prayer.  It is newly revealedby God to his messenger.  Fight but fight in the way of Godagainst those who fight against you.  Drive them out of the placeswhere they drove you out  for persecution is worse than slaughter.  Fight them until persecution is no more  and religion is for God.  But if they stop  let there be no more war...  for God never lovesthe starter of wars.  So fight in the way of God  against those who fight against you   God is great God is great God is great   God is great God is great  These are the disciplinesthe Prophet puts upon you.  You may not harm a womana child or any old person  You may not harm cripples  You may not harm theman that works in the field  You may not cut down trees  Strike only at those who have expelled you  Who have stolen your rights andriched themselves with your possessions  Now to the wells of Badr  News from Medina  Arm... arm yourselvesArm yourselves  Defend your wealth  Muhammad has come out of Medinato attack the great caravan   How many men? Three hundred two horses.  We man a  horses.How many camels?   Seventy. We'll bring a hundred and seventy  And load twenty of my camelswith wine we'll make a feast of it.  This is a war I'd like to fight  a war we cannot lose  Ride to Abu Sofyan's caravantell him to turn towards Badr.  We will join our forcestomorrow at the wells of Badr.  The wells of Badr here.  Muhammad's march here.  My charge of the caravan here.  One day's march...  meet them at the wells.  I don't like it.  There is too much of Meccain my caravan to be risked.  Put out the firesHold the camels  We are turning westaway from the wells.  Away?You can't  You must meet them at Badr.  We can drink them down like raw eggs.  If I run all night I'll be out ofMuhammad's reach by morning.  Where is your honor Abu Sofyan?  Honor?  My honor is on thebacks of my camels.  Yes I run...  Muhammad has occupied the wells  He has moved directlyinto our line of march.  Abu Sofyan has broken camp.He's moving west away from Badr.  The caravan is safe.  So there is no need to fight.  Not fight?  If we fight we will startblood feuds between brothers.  Between father and son you mean.  Hudayfa your own son is with themhe should have been whipped.  Mecca is greater than your family  Waleed your second sonhe is your true blood.  I say fight  We stand in the presentlet the future look after itself.  Otba is not a coward.  We finish them tomorrow.   We fight We fight  Are you finished?  Form ranks battle positions  Each man to his own place  Go back to your columns  Move away... move back  So Muhammad's filled the wells.  Now everyone brought herewill have to fight for theirs.  Good we fight  Brothers we hold the wells.  We stand in the name ofGod and his messenger.  We wait.  Send us your champions  (BATTLE OF BADR)  Who are you?  We expect our peersand our equals  Come back  My brother Shaiba  My son Waleed  And myself  Not you.  Ubaida and I...  and Al.  Are we your equals?  There is only one God  and Muhammad is His messenger.  Archers Advance  Archers  Hold...  stretch  Stretch  Stretch  Archers  Archers back  They are regrouping.  Forward  Ready  Lancers  God is great  Archers  God is great God is great  Umaya  Umaya  Bilal  God is great  Onward to victory  God is great  The Prophet has seen you  You are not to ropeor drag the prisoners   They would've roped us Cut them loose  I said cut them loose  And give them water  And share your foodequal mouthfulls.  And if they walk walk beside them.  Any prisoner who can teach Muslims to read... will go free.  Why don't they go away?  Because they blame me Hindfor whatever reason good or bad.  I should have joined them anddrown at the wells of Badr with them...  but I saved the caravanand our future with it.  Why sing at me  Why sing my father andmy brother as it's not me?  Do you think Ineed you to remind me?  Muhammad Al Hamza  With my nails Hamza  I will give you measure formeasure with my nails...  killer cut throat butcher  Murdering beast  You slaughtered my father  Hamza  I will hunt... a lion hunter  I will make Hamzaa running lion my prey.  And when you are dead HamzaI will cut your heart out  taste your bloodcut you into pieces  I forbit this wailing.it cannot go on.  What we should do we will do.  We will call in our alliesraise a new army against them.  This time we willprepare it and plan it.  Hamza  Come to prayer  Come to prayer  Come to victory  Come to victory  God is great  There is no god but God  Is it a plague?  What kind of an upside downtown have we come in to?  You could fill yourpockets very nicely here.  No merchant is minding his shop.  God is minding the shop.   Where do you come from? Yemen.  Did you stop in Mecca?  It is on the road.  You didn't answer my question  did you stop in Mecca?  Long enough to rest my camels.  Camels rest better in Meccathan anywhere in the world.  Yes.  What is the word on the desert?  Oh... it is bad for you.  They are gathering..  every young man with asword is on his way to Mecca.  Our strength is here.  Do not underestimate them.  They are summoning up their courage.  In Mecca there is music in every house.  An Abyssinian slave watch him.He is good he is vicious watch him  I will free you  give you your weight in silver  and your height in silk  for one throw like this.  So they have come at last.  We'll know how many soon enough.  It's a big army.  Three thousand menhundreds of horses.  We beat them at Badr.  That was a year ago.  They have come to revenge Badr.  Go home and get your swords.  Soldiers of Mecca  Blood master blood  Avenge the dead of Badr  (BATTLE OF UHUD)  There Hamza can you see him?  He is your fortune.  Ubada  Those horsemen on the flank out there  they're oddly placed.   They are under Khalid. Khalid?  I often thought of that young man.  Hamza  Yes?  The Prophet asks if youhave noticed those horsemen?  Yes I have.  I don't like them.  He's sending out archers to watch them.  No matter what happensthe archers must hold off those horsemen.  Zaid tell the Prophet we are ready.  What do you think Hamza?  Well they outnumber usso I'd say it's a fair fight.  We see themand they see us.  What faces me has never frightened me.   All praise be to Hubal Hubal  When Muhammad gives the word...  we will go to them.  Hamza  Weapons ready  We march... now  Attack  They've killed Hamza  On to them  You take this Fight back  Where are you going?  Fight Fight  Fight back  This is a moment of victory  They're running awayfrom us let's get the loot  Stand where you are told to stand  Come back to your positions  All of you come back  It's a road  Our centre is gone  We've lost the battle Khalid  Not yet.  Hold on  Where is the prophet?  Muhammad is deadI saw him fall  No no He's alive Find him  Back back to the mountains  Halt  I thought we were beaten  Now victory is yours Khalid.  We have no victory untilwe have finished Muhammad.  He is up in those rocks.  We have finished our businesswe have avenged Badr.  But we can end him and Islam forever.  Some of his fanatics are still with him.  They have theadvantage of the mountains  the risk is too high.  Muhammad listen  A day for a day  The day of Uhubfor the day of Badr  Our dead have answered to your dead  Our dead are in paradiseyour dead are in hell fire  Hamza... Hamza  Do you hear me Hamza?  Do you know thatI am with you I Hind  Do you remember anything Hamza?  How you killed myfather and my brother?  Now you too are dead  My heart is lightDo you hear Hamza? Light  But I haven't finished with you  Death is too small.  Wahsh cut him open cut him  They lost a battleand what do they do?  They come home anddig the ground harder.   They're mad. I agree with you  They defy reasonthey are even happy they lost  God sent their defeat they sayto try them in their faith.  Oh yes They arefighting with the sky.  They'll get what they want.  They want Mecca.  They'll get Mecca.  When we see the stars at noon...  Don't underestimate themI've learned that to my cost.  My friend Mecca ismore than their home.  It's where God spoke to man.  Mecca is like a...homesickness to the soul.  This year they're going as pilgrims.  What?  Unarmed.  Unarmed?  Abu Sofyan will slaughterthem in the desert.  If you believe in God as they do  it might be possiblenot to get slaughtered.  But I agree with youthey probably will be.  Be still  Do not let them provoke youthat is what they want  Stand firm  Peace be to you.  The Prophet says All who love God  must renew their oaths to him.  Under the tree  They've sent someone else.  It's Suheil  That means we mightcome to an agreement.  Muhammad you have beengiven conditions of truce  between yourself and Mecca.  Have you agreed to them yet?  What is this?  In the name of God the most gracious...  Who is this new Godthey call gracious?  I do not know himstrike him out.  And I cannot agree with this...  \"Muhammad the messenger of God?\"  If I have thought youwere the messenger of God  I would not have fought you.  Make it \"Muhammad the son of Abdullahagrees with Suhayl the son of Amr.\"  That is more factual.  Well so I understand.  Good that is better.  Now it is agreed...  that you do notcontinue your pilgrimage  you must turn around and go home.  Mecca is home.  However...  you may continue yourpilgrimage next year  and for  days only  in and out.  We also agree to thetruce for  years.  During that time  you will not attack any tribe  or ambush any caravan  or any individual associatedwith us and vice versa.  If you injure any oneof us the truce ends...  ...and vice versa.  Is that clear?  Ten years ten years of peace.  We need that time.  We will use that time.  These letters from Muhammadmessenger of God  to the rulers of the world...  ...call the world to Islam  To Heraclius Emperor of Byzantium  Kisra Emperor of Persia  Muqawqis Patriarch of Alexandria.  God go with you  God is great God is great God is great  There are no different races in Islam.  An Arab is not superior to a foreigner.  Nor a white man superior to a black.  All return equally to God.  Unless you desire for your neighbourwhat you desire for yourself...  ...you don't have faith.  A man goes to bed with his belly fullwhile his neighbor is hungry...  ...he isn't a Muslim.  The Ink of a scholar is holierthan the blood of a martyr.  A man reading is handsomein the sight of God.  So learn to read.  And when you have learned...  ...teach  The people of the book  the Jews with their Biblethe Christians with their testament  must be respected by you.  For their books likewisecame from God.  You must not think ofMuhammad as more than a man.  He was collecting firewood one day.  \"Let me do it\" I said.  \"Why?\" he said.  \"You are the prophet of God\"  \"You can't go aroundscratching for firewood.\"  But he looked at me mumbling  \"God does not like the man who considershimself above other men\" he said.  So I laid back and watched him.  Suddenly he stopped.  He stood to his fullheight and came to me.  \"Yes I am the prophet of God\" he said.  \"But even I do not knowwhat will become of me.\"  Amr have you come to take me again?  No.  I have come to ask you to take me.  I witness that there is only one God  and that Muhammad is His messenger.  May God forgive me the timesI have fought against you.  Islam does away withall that went before it.  I'm sorry I came in here wearing...  Here are my jewels.  What they are worth...  ...I give to the poor.   And may I offer you my... Yes.  But you were thebitterest sword against Islam.  Now by the will of God...  ...I will be the raised sword of God.  Ah its all easy to God.  Just as he makes dying livinghe can make losing winning.  Two years ago we thought we werebeaten when we had to sign that truce.  Look at us now.  Charging from victory tovictory in the hearts of men.  What's that?  Abu Sofyan is comingAbu Sofyan  Why am I insulted like this?  I'm Abu Sofyan  I expect some courtesy  We are not at warwe have a truce  I have come to speak toMuhammad where is he?  He is in the mosque.  Muhammad we did not break the truce.  I have come to reaffirm the truce.  I speak for Mecca.  Muhammad why do you turn from me?  Don't go.  Muhammad don't go  Bedouins broke the truce not us  The night was dark  I am here to testifythe night was dark  Barra Barra this is your city  Hudayfa you are my kinaim to see for me  I must be heard  I am Mecca  I am the leader of Mecca  Why am I insulted like this?  Because you keep no promiseand respect no pledge.  I have heard whatI never thought I'd hear  Abu Sofyan asking for pity.  To be outfought outfought  outmaneuvered by a onetime shepherd  You saw that shepherd'sreligion grow from a speck.  Speck was in my eye...  I could see nothing.  Tell Mecca their gods are dead.  It is useless to resist God.  Travel fast or every man herewill be close behind you.  It's you who have broken the truce.  iFor tonight will be ten thousandmen from every tribe.  Now we can fight them you are back.  We will close the streetsand defend from the houses.  It's no use.  There are thousands of themevery hour they are joined by more.  You coward  Hind go home  You coward  Are you the leader of Mecca?  Look at yourself  You are broke they swallowedyou and spat you back  Did my father and brother diefor my husband to run away?  You go home You  We can not resist Mecca is taken.  No no  We are to camp here for the night.  I can see Mecca eventhrough the mountains.  So many fires I cannot count them.  It's very beautiful.  When we drove them out of Mecca  I did not know theycarried Mecca with them.  We can smell the bread they're baking.  Yes it means they don't intend to plunder  at least I hope that's what it means.  They don't want blood ontheir own walls and doorsteps.  I can bargain with that.  Take me to him.  So you are giving us the city?  You offer me no bread.  I understand.  You may decide to kill me.  Say what you have come to say.  I saw your fires  the men around them  and I know what poweryou put into your men.  We can no longer resist Muhammad.  Now if you'll agree.  You dare to come hereand ask for conditions?  Isn't it time yet for you torecognize who Muhammad is?  Muhammad there isstill doubt in my heart.  If I were to cut off your headit would remove all your doubts.  Khalid  there's no compulsion in religion.  A man may take many yearsor only need minutes.  It's God who decides the time.  So respect his doubts.  You're a black slaveyou are the best school.  I am only what God has given me.  Yes.  The gods that I worshipped  they don't have any use.  It would have helped me.  I declare under no compulsion  there is one God  and you are the messenger of God.  Now let me go.  Get inside  No doors may be broken downnothing plundered nothing seized  No one abused  All behind closed doors are safe  All in Abu Sofyan's house are safe  All by the Kaaba are safe  At least he kept his wordthey haven't forced a door.  He's stolen hearts not walls.It's a permanent victory.  I dread going out.  We must we must at the end.  Were we so wrong?  The way we livedyes that was wrong.  We were trapped in our own faults.  Our gods were less than us.  Now there he is makinghis entrance to the Kaaba.  iIn the name of Godmost gracious most merciful.  iGod gave this house toAbraham to be a sacred place.  iWorship no other gods but Himand cleanse his house.  iSo it was.  iMuhammad took norevenge and allowed none.  iHe declared Mecca a holy place.  iNo one may shed bloodor cut down a tree  ior kill a living thing in Mecca.  iSoon all Arabia was converted.   Not only to the new worship  ibut to the new laws mannersattitudes contained in Islam.  iThe Prophet had livedto see his work done  ibut now he began tofeel the nearness of death.  iOne great act of hisprophethood remained  ithe setting of it's seal.  iHe called the people to him  iand he spoke for the last timeHis message of surrender to God  iand humanity to man.  ''Oh mankind Listen well\"  \"I may not be with you much longer.\"  \"The weak among youfeed them on what you eat.\"  \"Dress them as you are dressed.\"  \"You will meet your God\"  \"and He will call you toaccount for your actions.\"  \"Let those who are presentwarn those who are absent.\"  \"You are all are descendant from Adam\"  \"and the best among youis he who most regards God.\"  \"Think deeply about what I say.\"  \"Let all your feuds be abolished.\"  \"You must know that every Muslimis the brother of every other Muslim.\"  \"And all Muslims arebrothers one of another.\"  \"Between Muslims thereare no races and no tribes.\"  \"Nor must you takeanything from your brother\"  \"except what is given freely.\"  \"Do not oppressand do not be oppressed.\"  \"O my people\"  \"I am but a man.\"  \"It may be that the angelof death will visit me soon\"  \"and death will overtake me.\"  \"But I have left you a book\"  \"revealed by God the Quran\"  \"which is light and guidance.\"  iNow he repeated to the peoplethe final revelation of the Quran  ithe seal and termination  inot Muhammad's wordsbut God's word  ''This day I have perfectedyour religion for you\"  \"and completed my favour to you\"  \"and I've chosen for youIslam as your religion.''  iOn June the th   iin his rd year  iMuhammad died.  iMany of his followerscould not believe the fact.  iHow can such a man die?  iBut Abu Bakr the Prophet's friendstood up in the mosque  \"If anyone worships Muhammad\"  \"let him know that Muhammad is dead.\"  \"But he who worships God\"  \"let him know that Godis alive and can not die.''  iThey buried Muhammadbeside his mosque in Medina.  iBut the religion he preachedfound it's place in the heart of man.  iIt endured. It multiplied.  iStill to Mecca they come mankind.  iThe people of Islamdressed in their pilgrim white.  iAll equal before God  iall united in this place of prayer.  iEach individual soul joinedin a community of worship  \"ONE GOD\"     \n",

              "'In the name of God the most gracious the most Merciful.  From Muhammad the Messenger of God  to Heraclius the emperor of Byzantium.  greetings to him who is thefollower of righteous guidance.  I bid you to hear the divine call.

Yes that's correct.  And as if that weren'tenough of a challenge  you'll also be overseeingthe government's plans  for the refurbishmentof Barfield.  Yes I am.  Now the press believethat your appointment  may have beena publicity stunt...  I do not believethat my appointment  was in any waya publicityseeking campaign  by the prison services.  Also joining us this morningis Sarah Smith.  Sarah you feel very differentlyabout criminals don't you?  Eight years agoI was raped and mugged  only a few yardsfrom my own home.  I sustained injuries to my spine  and have been unable to walkany distance since.  My house was recently burgledalthough the police doubted  if the two crimeswere connected.  I was unable to dealwith the terror that he had...  the man who raped mehad come back.  There was a reason for thatwasn't\",\n",

And you connected the burglarywith the rapist?  Yes I did.  You see by that time  he'd already been releasedfrom his prison.  WOMANAnd how did this make you feel?  Angry. Very angry  I live with a life sentencenot him.  I just want to knowthat he's locked up  and unable to hurtand abuse another woman.  Miss Hewitt do you believethat more government support  is given to the criminalthan to the victim?  Every victimhas a right to justice.  Of course they do.But that is not my job.  That is the jobof the law courts.  My job is to ensure that theperpetrators are rehabilitated  so that when they leave prison  they are no longera threat to society.  SMITHBut it doesn't work.

              "  'todayit\\'s not surprising...  Why doesn\\'t the government  spend more money on the victimsand not the criminals?  The main costs areto ensure total security  so that a prisoner cannot escapeand endanger the public.  II do understandand feel for the victims  such as Miss Smith  and of coursethey should be cared for  but there areat this present time  over  men in prison.  We cannot operate  a \"lock them upand throw away the key\" regime  which achievesabsolutely nothing.  We must at all costsrehabilitate them  so that they do not reoffend.  Sarah did you receiveany compensation?  Â£.  Â£.  It\\'s a very small amountin comparison  with the estimated Â£ millionworth of damage done  during the recent riotsat Barfield.  Surely if the intentionwas to rehabilitate  the men held therethen it failed.  The comfort or thesoftly softly\" approach...  I\\'ve no intention of applyinga soft approach  to my term as governor.
